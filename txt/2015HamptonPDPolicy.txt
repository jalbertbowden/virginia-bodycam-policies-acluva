The individual officer will be responsible for maintaining a log of what
incidents are recorded on each hard drive (referenced by police unit
number). This log shall be maintained by the officer for later reference
for court purposes.

Officers with DVR systems in their vehicles will contact their supervisor
immediately to have their hard drive removed and replaced in the event
an incident has been recorded and is for court purposes. Every two
weeks or when there is less than two hours of recording time (which ever
comes first), all hard drives will be removed and replaced whether they
are of evidentiary value or not.

Road Corporals and Sergeants will be issued keys to the hard drive
vault. A supervisor will be the only one permitted to unlock the vault to
allow a hard drive to be removed and/or replaced.

Shift Supervisors will be responsible to maintain a sufficient number of
hard drives to replace those utilized by patrol officers

Once removed the hard drive will be given to the officer whose car the
hard drive was removed from. That officer will respond immediately to
the Property and Evidence Locker area where they will place the hard
drive in the Video Locker, and assure it is locked. They will
log the hard

(Monday — Friday), removing the hard drive, and signing the video log
with their name/CAD indicating they have taken custody of the hard
drive.

The Special Project’s Supervisor will assure that all hard drives are
uploaded to the server as soon as they are received. All videos will be
uploaded to the server whether they are of evidentiary value or not.
