Police

All trained, 
uniformed patrol 
personnel.

Shall activate prior to arriving 
on-scene.  Shall activate when 
responding to a scene when 
they have detained or arrested 
a person; are attempting to 
detain or arrest a person; or  
are likely to detain or arrest a 
person.  Specifics include: 
traffic stops; pursuits; DUI 
investigations ; warrant 
service; investigatory stop; any 
contact that becomes 
adversarial in an incident that 
would not otherwise require 
recording. In those situations, 
it may be impractical or 
unreasonable for officers to 
activate BWCs before taking 
police action.  Once the 
immediacy of the situation is 
over, officers will activate their 
BWC to record the remainder 
of the incident.  Officers may 
activate BWCs anytime they 
believe its use would be 
appropriate and/or valuable to 
document an incident.

Notice only applies 
to recordings of a 
member of the 
department.  
Otherwise, no 
requirement in 
policy.

Once the camera is activated 
it shall remain on until the 
incident has concluded, 
which occurs when: all 
arrests have been made and 
arrestees have been 
transported; all witnesses 
and victims have been 
interviewed; recording may 
cease if no further law 
enforcement action is likely 
to occur (e.g., waiting for a 
tow truck or a family 
member to arrive.).  There 
may be instances in which an 
officer is required to take 
immediate action to an event 
that occurs directly in front 
of them which may not allow 
time to activate their camera. 
In these circumstances, the 
officer shall activate their 
camera as soon as practical 
that allows the officer to 
safely contain the situation.
