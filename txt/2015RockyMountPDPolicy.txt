PURPOSE

The use of Body Worn Digital Recording (BWDR) System provides an
unbiased audio/video recording of events that officers encounter. These
recordings can be useful for the documentation of evidence, the
preparation of offense reports, and future court testimony. These
recordings can also protect officers from false allegations of misconduct
and be of use when debriefing incidents or evaluating performance. This
policy covers the use of the department issued and personally owned
BDWR systems.
