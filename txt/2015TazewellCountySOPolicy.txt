1-06 Code of Ethics

VLEPSC STANDARDS: ADM.01.02

Law Enforcement Code of Ethics

As a Law Enforcement Officer, my fundamental duty is to serve mankind; to safeguard lives
and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression, of
intimidation and the peaceful against violence, and to respect the constitutional rights of all
men/women to liberty, equality, and justice.

I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all, maintain calm in the face of danger,
scorn, or ridicule; develop self-restrain; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others.
Honest in thought and deed in both my personal and official life. I will be exemplary in obeying
the laws of the land and the regulations of my Office. Whatever, I see or hear of a confidential
nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation
is necessary in the performance of any duty.

I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities, or friendships to
influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of
criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill
will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never expecting gratuities.

I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to
be held so long as I am true to the ethics of the police service.  I will constantly strive to
achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession of
law enforcement.

PURPOSE

I

II.

III.

PROCEDURE

GOVERNMENT STANDARDS
A.  The F.L.S.A.:

1.  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regulates minimum wage, overtime pay, child

labor and dictates certain record keeping requirements.  

2.  The FLSA does not require the following:

a.  Vacation
b.  Holidays
c.  Severance, or Sick Pay g.  A discharge notice or reason for discharge
d.  Meal or rest periods

e.  Premium pay for weekends or holiday work
f.   Pay raises or fringe benefits

h.  Maximum work hours for employees over 16
years old

B.  Who is Affected:

1.  State and local government employees engaged in traditional government activities

are subject to the FLSA. Those employees specifically engaged in law
enforcement activities are subject to a special section of the Act (7K), which
provides for a partial overtime exemption applied on a work period basis as
opposed to the more restrictive workweek basis. 

2.  An employee engaged in "law enforcement activities" refers to any employee who

is 
a.  Empowered to enforce laws designed to maintain peace and order, and to

protect life and property, and to prevent or detect crimes, 

b.  Who has the power of arrest, and 
c.  Who is presently undergoing, has undergone or will undergo on the job training

and/or a course of instruction or study in self-defense, firearms, criminal and

Page  41

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-09 Overtime Compensation  
 

civil law principles, investigative and enforcement techniques, community
relations, medical aid and ethics. (Title 29, Part 553.211 FLSA)

3.  Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office employees engaged in law enforcement activities

and support staff alike, can get Compensation and/or overtime pay if they are
full-time employees. Sworn employees have to work over 171 hours in a 28 day
time period to receive compensation.  Anything past 171 is calculated at time and
half. Non-sworn employees receive compensation for hours worked past the 40
hour workweek at time and half.

4.  There are exceptions in which certain individuals in the Office are considered

"EXEMPT" and are not subject to the overtime provisions of the FLSA, whether
engaged in "law enforcement activities" or not. These are discussed below.

C.  Hours Worked:

1.  OFF DUTY: Periods during which the employee is completely relieved from duty

and can use the time effectively for his or her own purposes.  (Title 29 Part 785.16
FLSA)

2.  ON CALL: If an employee must only leave word as to where they can be reached
or if they carry a pager, they are not considered restricted under the Act and these
hours are not considered HOURS WORKED. Even though the employee may not
be able to go out of town for the day or weekend, they are still considered
unrestricted under the act. If, however, an employee has to stay by his or her
phone at home to receive calls when the employer's office is closed, the employee
is considered restricted and the hours "on call" in this situation would be counted
as hours worked.  (Title 29 Part 785.17 FLSA)

D.  Regular and Overtime Pay:

1.  RATE OF PAY: The regular rate is calculated at an hourly rate.Compensation due

employees must be completed based on the hourly rate derived from the salary
amount by mathematical computation. (Title 29 Part 778.109 FLSA)

2.  COMPENSATORY TIME: Compensatory time will be given only after sworn

deputies work past the 171 hours in a 28 day time period over their regular shift
non-sworn is anything past 40 hours work in a workweek. Compensatory time is
calculated monthly. 

3.  TIME OFF PLAN: An employer can comply with FLSA and continue to pay a fixed
salary even when an employee works overtime in some workweek within the same
PAY period (month). The employer lays off the employee for a sufficient number of
hours (1.5 to 1) during some other week of the SAME PAY PERIOD so that the
fixed salary for the pay period covers the total amount of compensation, including
the overtime compensation, due the employee for each work week taken
separately.  (WH Pub. 1459).

E.  Overtime:

1.  If an employee works an amount of time surpassing the required time,

compensation time will be awarded. If occasions occur and there are funds
available to pay an employee monetarily at an overtime rate, this will be managed
through the administrative office and if overtime pay is not available they will
receive compensatory time.

2.  Avoidance: Working past regularly assigned daily or shift hours should be avoided

unless the necessity can be documented. (The Administrative Office requires an
explanation for all overtime, by means of a 28 day time sheet that has to be signed
by there supervisor, who is responsible for the calculations on the time sheet).  

Page  42

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-09 Overtime Compensation  
 

3.  Items considered for approval of compensation time:

a.  For special assignments authorized by supervisory personnel (includes

assignment to cover absent deputy's shift for example, appearances in courts
which includes regular and special grand juries in criminal cases, appearances
in out of jurisdiction courts in criminal cases, off-duty time spent for mandatory
office functions such as training and meetings; 

b.  Working past the end of a shift in order to complete an arrest, complaint,
investigation or overtime earned for some other justifiable and absolutely
necessary purpose will be considered as AUTHORIZED overtime but it must be
approved at that time by the on-duty supervisor.

c.  Unessential overtime such as staying over just to ride or visit with another

deputy on the next shift is not authorized. Supervisors will closely evaluate the
necessity of all overtime.

4.  Compensatory Time: The preferred method of reimbursement for overtime is

compensatory time given within the 28-day cycle.

5.  Each supervisor will be responsible for the accurate and timely completion of this

SUBJECT:  Communicable Disease
EFFECTIVE DATE:    January 2006

VLEPSC STANDARDS: PER.10.01,

PERSONNEL
NUMBER:  2-13
REVISED:   May 2008
APPROVED:

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.

II.

POLICY
Notify personnel about risks, modes of transmission, and procedures for handling
communicable diseases such as Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and AIDS-related infections.

PURPOSE
Procedures to be followed when a member of the Sheriff’s Office is exposed to a
communicable disease with a risk of major illness or death, and for handling of evidence or
property that may be contaminated.

III.

PROCEDURE

A. The Sheriff, through all division heads, shall ensure that every Office vehicle will each

contain bio hazard, disposable gloves, and first aid kits. 

B. Deputies using supplies in their vehicles shall replace them or arrange to have them

replaced as soon as possible.

C. Personnel shall use protective equipment under all appropriate circumstances unless the

deputy can justify otherwise.

D. All personnel whose skin comes into contact with body fluids of another shall begin

disinfections procedures immediately: these procedures range from simple
soap-and-water washing to the use of alcohol or antiseptic towelettes. All open cuts and
abrasions shall be covered with waterproof bandages before personnel report for duty.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS
A.  General  

Whenever possible, deputies shall wear disposable latex gloves when doing any of the
following:
1. Handling persons or items with any blood or body fluid products (hypodermic needles,

syringes, or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids, gun or knife wounds).

2. Packaging and handling such items as evidence.
3. Cleaning up blood or other secretions that appear on floors, seats, equipment,

Page  60

handcuffs, shoes, clothing, pens, pencils.

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-13 Communicable Disease  
 

B.  Specialized Devices 

1. Masks shall be worn whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of potentially

infectious fluids endanger contamination through the eyes, nose, or mouth.  
2. Gowns, shall be worn as determined by the degree of exposure anticipated.

C.  Handling people

1. Wash hands thoroughly for thirty seconds with warm water and soap after removing

gloves (when handling evidence) or after contact with the subject (if bleeding or
vomiting). If water is unavailable, use pre-moistened towelettes found in the
communicable disease control kit to decontaminate skin.

2. Leather gloves or their equivalent shall be worn when searching persons or dealing in

environments, such as accident scenes, where sharp objects and bodily fluids may
reasonably be encountered.  Search techniques shall be used that require suspects to
empty their own pockets or purses and remove sharp objects from their persons.
Remember: Never put your hands where your eyes cannot see.

3. When transporting prisoners

a.  Transport persons with body fluids on their persons in separate vehicles from other

persons.  A person who is bleeding or producing a fluid may have to wear a
protective covering.

b.  Notify other support personnel or law enforcement deputies during a transfer of
custody that the suspect has fluids on his or her person, or that the suspect has
stated that he or she has a communicable disease.  Booking forms should so
state.

D.  Handling objects

1. Objects contaminated with body fluids shall be completely dried, double bagged, and

marked to identify possible disease contamination.

2.  Contaminated items to be disposed of shall be autoclaved.

a.  To autoclave, items must be treated in special (biohazard) bags at a high

temperature. Local laboratories or hospitals can assist.

b.  Before burning, the bags must be closed with autoclave tape, which turns purple

when the microbes are dead

3.  Deputies shall use extra care when handling any sharp objects. If deputies find

syringes, they shall not bend, recap, or otherwise manipulate the needle in any way,
but shall place them in puncture-resistant containers provided by the Sheriff’s Office.

E.  Handling fluids

1.  Office vehicles within which body fluids are spilled require immediate disinfections
procedures. Appointees who have the vehicles assigned to them shall notify their
supervisor of the spill and arrange for a thorough cleaning as soon as possible.

F.  Precautions when bitten

The danger of infection through bites is low. The victim cannot be infected with HIV
through the blood of the biting person unless that person has blood in his or her mouth,
which comes into contact with the victim's blood. HIV cannot be transmitted through
saliva. With HBV, however, transmission takes place through infected blood or
blood-derived body fluids. Infection takes place by exposure of the eyes, mouth, or
mucous membranes to the virus.  Precautionary procedures to minimize the risk of
infection include:

Page  61

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-13 Communicable Disease  
 

1.  Encouraging the wound to bleed by applying pressure and gently "milking" the wound.
2.  Washing the area thoroughly with soap and hot running water.
3.  Seeking medical attention at the nearest hospital.
4.  Advising your supervisor, make a report, or follow any other policy for reporting

injuries, including the filing of appropriate Worker's Compensation forms.

G.  Precautions when punctured by needles or knives

If a deputy is cut or punctured by a needle or a knife or other instrument while searching
a suspect or handling contaminated evidence, follow these general guidelines:
1.  Allow the wound to bleed (unless severe bleeding occurs) until all flow ceases. Then

cleanse the wound with alcohol-based cleanser (or pre-moistened towelettes) and
then with soap and water. Do not rely exclusively on towelettes: wash wounds
thoroughly with soap and water.

2.  Seek medical attention as soon as possible after the injury. A physician will then

decide the proper treatment.

3.  Advise your supervisor, make an incident report, and follow any other policy for

reporting injuries, including the filing of appropriate Worker's Compensation forms.

IV.OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES

A.  As soon as practicable, all employees shall document possible exposure to infectious
fluids or materials. In any case, employees shall immediately notify their supervisor of
possible exposure. Virginia Code 32.1-45.2 requires public safety employees to
immediately notify their agencies of any possible exposure prone incident. 

1. AIDS/ARC/HIV

a. Blood tests can detect HIV antibodies (produced by the body's immune system).
b. The two common tests for HIV antibodies are the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked

Immunosorbent Assay) and the Western Blot. Since the ELISA is less expensive
and easier to perform, it is usually used as a first screen for HIV. If the ELISA
identifies the person as seropositive, a second ELISA is performed. If the second
test is also positive, a Western Blot is usually performed to confirm the results.
c. Since HIV antibodies may not develop for some months after a person has been

infected, an initial negative result may not mean freedom from infection. Typically,
three to six months elapse following an infection for a positive reaction to occur.
High false positive rates also occur with the use of only ELISA test.

d. One must be tested, then, immediately following the incident (for a baseline) and

then six and twelve months later.

e. The Office shall ensure that the appointee receives qualified counseling during the

testing period.

f. The Virginia State Public Health Office provides free confidential or anonymous
testing (both ELISA and Western Blot) in every health district.  The results are
given only to the person tested. State law, under §§ 32.l-36.l, provides
confidentiality and prescribes a penalty.

2.  Hepatitis B & C 

A blood test can confirm the presence of Hepatitis B virus six to eight weeks after
exposure. 

3.  Tuberculosis 

 

Page  62

This disease is detected first by a skin test, and then confirmed by an x-ray.  

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-13 Communicable Disease  
 

B.  Confidentiality

Confidentiality of information concerning test results is paramount. The victim has a right
to privacy in employer-maintained information about his/her health. No need exists for a
supervisor routinely to know that a person tests positive (for HIV or Hepatitis B). The
Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office views a breach of confidentiality as a serious disciplinary
problem, which may result in suspension, or termination of employment.
1.  Under most circumstances, medical authorities will retain confidential records unless

the appointee tested requests it or state law requires it.

C.  Positive test results

Any person who tests positive for HIV or Hepatitis B shall not be summarily removed from
duty. The Sheriff’s Office shall make no restrictions simply because of diagnosis. These
diseases are not spread by casual contact (as between coworkers in the Sheriff’s Office).
The Sheriff’s Office shall alter an appointee’s assignment only when he or she can no
longer perform the required duties.

D. The Sheriff’s Office shall ensure continued testing, if necessary, of members for evidence

of infection, and shall provide psychological counseling if necessary.

E. Any person who tests positive for tuberculosis may be restricted from working for a period

of time. The medical evaluation will determine the stage and type of disease the person
has contracted and if he/she is contagious. A tuberculosis-infected person requires
medication and shall not return to work until the doctor says he/she is
non-communicable.  

F.  Job performance

Communicable disease:  Infected appointees shall continue working as long as they
maintain acceptable performance and do not pose a safety or health threat to themselves
or others in the Sheriff’s Office.

G.  Where feasible, an appointee who has medical complications from a communicable

disease will either be reassigned to another job or have his/her job restructured so that
he/she can remain employed. As necessary, medical documentation shall support
requests for job restructure reassignment. All personnel shall treat such appointees in the
same manner as appointees who suffer from other serious diseases or handicaps: that
is, fairly, courteously, and with dignity.

H.  The Sheriff’s Office may require an appointee to be examined by the Sheriff’s Office

physician to determine if he/she is able to perform his/her duties without hazard to
him/herself or others.

I.  Federal law

The Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 generally protects appointees infected by
communicable diseases.

J.  Discrimination

The Sheriff’s Office expects all personnel to continue working relationships with any
fellow appointee recognized as having AIDS/ARC, Hepatitis B, or non-communicable
tuberculosis. The Sheriff’s Office will consider appropriate corrective or disciplinary action

Page  63

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-13 Communicable Disease  
 

against an appointee who threatens or refuses to work with an infected appointee or who
disrupts the  Sheriff’s Office's mission.

K.  Records

The agency maintains a record for each appointee detailing incidents of occupational
exposure, including information on vaccination status; the results of examinations and
tests; health care professionals' written opinion; and any other relevant information.
These records are retained by the Sheriff in secure storage for the duration of tenure of
employment plus 30 years, and shall not be disclosed or reported without the
express written consent of the appointee.  The Office Manager or her designee is
responsible for the coordination of the communicable disease program.

VIII. TRAINING

Education on communicable diseases shall be continuous in the Sheriff’s Office. The
training deputy shall ensure that all members of the agency with occupational exposure shall
receive a course of instruction on blood borne diseases before their initial assignment.
Further, each affected appointee will receive annual refresher training plus any additional
training appropriate to the particular appointee assignment.

POLICY
The illegal use of narcotic drugs and controlled substances, including any prohibited use of
alcohol by employees of the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office will not be tolerated. This
policy is deemed necessary to maintain the integrity of the Sheriff’s Office and to ensure
safety of its employees and the public.  

PURPOSE
To establish a policy and procedure for the administration of the Drug/Alcohol Screening
Program.  

PROCEDURES
A.  General

1. All employees may be randomly required to provide a specimen of their urine for drug

analysis. The Sheriff or the next in command will randomly choose the individuals to
be tested. Refusal to submit immediately to a urinalysis when directed by the Sheriff
or the next in command will constitute insubordination and the employee could be
subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Employees who
are notified to provide a specimen of their urine for a drug screening analysis will
immediately report to the medical facility or collection site designated by the Sheriff.

B.  Reasonable Suspicion

1. Reasonable Suspicion Testing:  When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an
employee uses or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or controlled substances,
the Sheriff or the next in command may require that an employee provide a specimen
of his/her urine for testing to determine if traces of drugs exist in the system of the
employee. If use of alcohol is suspected, the individual will be directed by Sheriff or
the next in command to submit to an Alco sensor test. If the results of the Alco sensor
test are positive, the individual will be directed to submit to a Breathalyzer test. Any of
the following, while not all inclusive, may constitute reasonable suspicion:

a.  Slurred speech;
b. Odor of alcoholic beverage on person;
c. Inability to walk in a straight line;
d. Verbal or physical altercation;
e. Behavior which is so unusual that it warrants summoning a supervisor; 

Page  65

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
PERSONNEL
2-14 Drug & Alcohol Testing
 

f. Unauthorized or illegal possession of alcoholic beverages or drugs while on duty
g. Information received from a reliable person with personal knowledge;
h. Results of acceptable methods or tests.

2. Employees who have been asked to submit to an Alco sensor test, Breathalyzer test,

and/or urinalysis must be informed of the reason, i.e. the facts of reasonable
suspicion for which the specimen is being requested. Further, they should be
informed that if the test shows positive results, the employee could be subject to
discipline, up to and including termination of employment.  

C.  Employee Submission to Drug Testing

1. When an employee is required to submit to a urine test, the employee will be

observed by a person of the same sex, in private. Refusal to submit immediately to a
test when directed will constitute insubordination and the employee could be subject
to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.  

2. The confirmed finding of an illicit narcotic drug or controlled substance as defined in

Sections 54.1-3446, 54.1-3448, 54.1-3450, 54.1-3452 and 54.1-3456, Code of
Virginia (1950), as amended, or alcohol in an employee of the Sheriff’s Office, will
result in immediate action as to be determined by the Sheriff. Exceptions are made if
a doctor for that employee prescribes the substance.    

D.  Employee Responsibility to Notify

1. The responsibility lies on the employee to notify the Sheriff or the next in command of

any narcotic prescribed to them, in writing from their physician.

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY

Shall comply with all instructions of the U.S. State Department relating to the arrest and
detention of foreign nationals, deaths of foreign nationals, the appointment of guardians
for minors and incompetent adults who are foreign nationals, in addition to the related
issues pertaining to the provision of consular services to foreign nationals with whom we
come into contact in this county.

PURPOSE

To establish guidance for employees to follow when a situation arises, involving the
arrest/detention of a foreign national or a consular official.  

PROCEDURES
A.  Definitions:

1. Consular Official is a citizen of a foreign country employed by a foreign government

and authorized to provide assistance on behalf of that government, to that
government’s citizens in a foreign country. 

2. Diplomatic Official is an officer of a foreign or domestic government. Authorized by
their government to perform consular functions. (this includes U.S. Congressmen
while Congress is in session, members of the National Guard, and members of a
religious order if en route to a religious function.)

3. Foreign Consulate is the office or the headquarters of a consul who represents a

foreign country in the United States. 

4. Foreign National is any person who is not a U.S. citizen, who owes personal

allegiance to a county other than the United States, and possesses Foreign National
documentation from the U.S. State Department of Security, also known as Aliens.

B.  Requirements pertaining to foreign nationals:

1. When foreign nationals are arrested or detained, they must be advised of the right to

have their consular officials notified.

I.

II.

III.

 

Page  94

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-07 Diplomatic Immunity & Foreign Nationals  
 

2.

In some cases, the nearest consular officials must be notified of the arrest or
detention of a foreign national, regardless of the national’s wishes.  The list of
countries, which require mandatory notification of consular officials on the event of
that one of their citizens, has been arrested is extensive.  The State Department shall
be contacted for guidance.  To determine the foreign national’s country, in the
absence of any other information, you may assume that this is the country listed on
the passport or on other travel documents the foreign national possesses. 

3. Consular officials are entitled to have access to their nationals in detention, and are

entitled to provide consular assistance. 

4. When a government official becomes aware of the death of a foreign national,

consular officials must be notified.

5. When a guardianship or trusteeship is being considered with respect to a foreign

national who is a minor or incompetent, consular officials must be notified.

6. When a foreign ship or aircraft wrecks or crashes, consular officials must be notified.

C. Diplomatic immunity from arrest or detention

All of the above mentioned officials will have identification cards issued by the State
Department.  If you have any doubt about the authenticity of the identification, you can
call the State Department’s Office of Security at 1-202-647-4415 or 1-202-647-4000
during regular business hours. During nights or weekends, call 1-202-647-1512 or
1-202-647-7277 to contact Diplomatic Security Services who will contact the Office of
Protocol if necessary.

1. Upon exhibiting proof of diplomatic immunity, persons shall be released if they were

being stopped for a misdemeanor traffic violation. If the question arises about this
procedure, or if a felony arrest is necessary, call and advise the United States State
Department of Security (day: 1-202-647-4415; or their operations center at
1-202-647-1512 during nights and weekends.)

2.  While a person claiming diplomatic immunity may present any number of identification

papers, the only one that is indicative of the level of privilege and immunity is a card
issued by the U.S. State Department.  The holder’s level of immunity will be indicated
on the card.  If a person claiming immunity does not possess this card and the
incident involves a criminal offense, officers may detain the person either at the scene
or at the department long enough to verify official status.

3. When encountering a criminal suspect who claims diplomatic immunity, officers shall
first take reasonable measures-including pat-downs or other legal searches-to ensure
safety of the public or other officers.  Verification of the diplomatic claim shall take
place after the danger has been neutralized.  A criminal investigation shall proceed if
no valid diplomatic immunity claim has been made. Interviews, interrogations,
seizures of evidence, or issuance of warrants shall proceed per departmental
procedure.  In a criminal investigation, the Sheriff, or his designee, shall remain in
contact with the U.S. State Department.

D. Steps to Follow When a Foreign National is Arrested or Detained

1. Determine the foreign national’s country.  In the absences of other information,

Page  95

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-07 Diplomatic Immunity & Foreign Nationals  
 

assume this is the country on the passport or other travel document the foreign
national may possess.

2.

3.

If the foreign national’s country is NOT on the mandatory notification list, then follow
the procedures below.

a. Offer, without delay, to notify the foreign national’s consular officials of the

arrest/detention.  

b. For a suggested statement to the foreign national, see Statement #1 in the
following section.  Translations of the statements can be found in the State
Department Blue Book located in the Communications Center 

If the foreign national’s country IS on the list of mandatory notification countries:

a. Notify that country’s nearest consular officials, without delay, of the

arrest/detention.

b. Phone and fax numbers are located at the end of this general order.  There is a

suggested informational fax sheet for making the notification in the State
Department Blue Book located in the Communications Center

c. Tell the foreign national that you are making this notification.  A suggested
statement to the foreign national is found at the end of this general order as
Statement #2 and can also be found in the State Department Blue Book located
in the Communications Center

d. Keep a written record of the provision of notification and actions taken

E.  Suggested Statements to Arrested or Detained Foreign Nationals
1. When Consular Notification is at the Foreign National’s Option:

“As a non-United States citizen who is being arrested or detained, you are entitled to
have us notify your Country’s consular representatives here in the United States.  A
consular official from your country may be able to help you obtain legal counsel, and
may contact your family and may visit you in detention, among other things.  If you
want us to contact your country’s consular officials, you can request this notification
now or any time in the future.  After your consular officials are notified, they may call
or visit you.  Do you want us to notify your country’s consular officials?”

2. When Consular Notification is Mandatory:

“Because of your nationality, we are required to inform your country’s consular
representatives here in the United States that you have been arrested or detained. 
After your consular officials are notified, they may call or visit you.  You are not
required to accept their assistance, but they may be able to help you obtain legal
counsel and may contact your family and visit you in detention, among other things. 
We will be notifying your country’s consular officials as soon as possible.”

liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of

directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then

III.

POLICY
To impose disciplinary action fairly and impartially. Discipline in the Sheriff’s Office involves
training, counseling, and as a last resort, punishment and there are no appeals.  All
disciplinary records shall be kept permanently in the employee’s personnel file.

PURPOSE
To establish procedures concerning informal and formal disciplinary practices within the
Office.

PROCEDURES
A.  DISMISSALS
All personnel of the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office work at the will and pleasure of the
Sheriff.  If the Sheriff makes it known to an employee that their services are no longer
needed, an explanation is not required.  This decision is final and procedures for
reprimands are not required.

B.   REPRIMANDS

1.  Consistency in discipline

and uniformly.  

a. The Office abides by the philosophy that discipline must be applied consistently

b. Employees are expected to have a reasonable perception of what constitutes

proper behavior, based on academy training, adherence to the Law Enforcement
Code of Ethics and the observance of the behavior of officers generally.

2.   Relief from duty

a. An employee may be relieved from duty whenever the Sheriff questions an

employee's physical or psychological fitness for duty.  Supervisors are
responsible for reporting inappropriate actions of the deputy’s they are
responsible for, directly to the Sheriff or the next in command.  

b. Supervisor’s have the authority to relieve an employee from shift duty, but must
promptly report this action to the Sheriff or the next  in command, accompanied
by a written report setting forth details and circumstances.

c. The Sheriff may suspend without pay an officer whose continued presence on

the job constitutes a substantial and immediate threat to the welfare of the

Page  97

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-08 Employee Discipline
 

department, the public, or to himself.

d. An officer who refuses to obey a direct order in conformance with the

department's orders may be relieved from duty by the Supervisor who may
recommend suspension to the Sheriff.  The Sheriff may then suspend without
pay.

3.   Steps of Discipline

The following penalties are available for use should a problem with an employee
occur:
a. Oral reprimands; counseling; training, payment of lost or damaged equipment.
b. Written reprimand.
c. Demotion or suspensions without pay.
d. Dismissal from Office.
1) Oral reprimands, while informal, require documentation without an employee’s

knowledge of such needed.

2) The reprimanding supervisor shall record the reprimand/counseling in a

memorandum to be maintained in the employees’ personnel file, located in the
Sheriff’s Office.
a) Employee's name;
b) Date of reprimand/counseling;
c) Summary of reasons for reprimand/counseling;
d) Summary of employee's response;
e) Suggestions for improvement or specific actions suggested;
 f)  Name of counselor and signature.

3) Oral reprimand/counseling may involve remedial training.  This training may be

deemed necessary to rectify the improper behavior.  Remedial training may
include attendance at academy classes, in-service, or other training specially
created to help the employee correct or modify his or her behavior.  Remedial
training is reasonably offered until the employee can demonstrate proficiency in
the corrected behavior.  

4) Supervisors are expected to counsel employees regularly without oral

reprimands.  Most counseling is informal, positive, supportive, and perhaps
undocumented.
a) Supervisors are responsible for counseling employees concerning job-related

matters, within their capabilities.  Many things can affect the job and an
employee's performance; so job-related counseling may involve family and
other individual, personal subjects.  Counseling may include identification of
unacceptable behaviors or actions; specifically what was done wrong and the
desired or acceptable performance.  Counseling can attempt to determine
the reason for the particular behavior, determine and recommend how to
correct or improve performance or to solve the problem.

b) A variety of counseling resources are available within the community

including psychological, family, marital, and financial counseling.  Employees
in need of counseling, or desiring information about available resources, are
encouraged to talk with the Sheriff or the next in command.  The Office
recognizes that no stigma is attached to seeking professional counseling to
solve problems.

4.  Written reprimand

A written reprimand cautions an employee about poor behavior, sets forth the
corrected or modified behavior mandated by the Office, and specifies the penalty in

Page  98

case of recurrent poor behavior.  A written reprimand becomes a permanent part of
the employee's personnel record. 

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION

5.  Suspension without pay

a. If the situation warrants, the Sheriff, may suspend without pay.
b. Suspensions without pay will normally apply to a period of up to 3- 15 days, as

determined by the Sheriff. 

c. Suspensions resulting from criminal investigations may be prolonged beyond 15

days pending court action.
1) In no case shall an employee convicted of a felony continue to work for the

2) If an employee is acquitted of criminal charges, the employee may yet be

disciplined at the discretion of the Sheriff or reinstated with full or partial back
pay.

d. Any employee suspended for a period ten days or longer shall return all

Office-owned property. 

e. During a suspension, the employee shall not undertake any official duties.

Office.  

6.  Demotion

Demotion shall be to a lower rank. The decision is made by Sheriff and is final.

7.  Transfer

a. Transfer of positions shall be at the discretion of the Sheriff.   
b. Transfer can be voluntary if the employee asked to be transferred and the

position is open and the Sheriff approves it.   

8.  Reporting arrests

a. Any employee arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any crime, or required
to appear as a defendant in any criminal or civil proceedings, must so inform the
Sheriff in writing as soon as possible.  

b. Failure to notify the Office of the foregoing shall be cause for punishment.

IV.

INFRACTIONS AND PUNISHMENTS
A.  General Guidelines

1. Except for gross breaches of discipline or moral turpitude, supervisors shall begin

employee discipline with the least punitive measures.  If these do not work, then
increasingly more severe measures may be required.  While this process may take
some time, it is important that each employee be dealt with justly and in a manner,
which clearly indicates that positive, constructive measures to change behavior or
performance preceded the imposition of more negative sanctions.

2. Unacceptable conduct is divided into three categories according to severity of

misbehavior.

a. Category I, Examples:
1) Excessive absences, tardiness. 
2) Abuse of duty time (too much time away from established duties; too much time

for personal business).

3) Abusive or obscene language.
4) Inadequate or unsatisfactory job performance.
5) Disruptive behavior

duty.

6) Use of alcohol or unlawful possession or use of a controlled substance while on

7) Reporting to work under the influence or when ability is impaired by alcohol or

the unlawful use of controlled substances.

8) Category I offenses are of minor severity yet require correction in the interest of

maintaining a productive and well-managed Office.

9) Category I offenses normally result, in the first offense, in informal measures

such as counseling, or perhaps oral reprimand/formal counseling.  Three
Category I offenses in one year may result in a written reprimand or suspension.
A fourth instance in one year shall provide grounds for longer suspension or
dismissal

(If the investigation of an accident yields findings that the accident was unavoidable
or occurred as a direct result of the performance of official duties and there was no
negligence on the part of the employee and further that no Office policies or safety
rules were violated, then no disciplinary action shall be taken against the employee.)

3. Category II, Examples:

comply with policy.

a. Failures to follow supervisor’s instructions, perform assigned work, or otherwise

b. Avoidable vehicle accidents wherein no safety rules were violated and the

accident resulted from minor negligence or inattention of the employee.

c. Violating safety rules without a threat to life. This includes vehicle accidents

where the employee was found to be at fault, but was not found to have acted
recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner.

d. Unauthorized time away from work assignments without permission during duty

hours.

e. Failure to report to work without proper notice to a supervisor.
f. Unauthorized use or misuse of Office property. 
g. Refusal to work overtime based on a reasonable request, or repeated refusals to

h. Category II offenses include more severe acts and misbehavior.  Category II

offenses normally result, in the first instance, in issuance of a written reprimand. 
A subsequent infraction within two years may result in suspension, demotion, or
dismissal.

4. Category III, Examples:

a. Absence in excess of three days without notice to a superior.
b. Insubordination or serious breach of discipline, willful disobedience.
c. Falsification of any reports such as, but not limited to, vouchers, official reports,

time records, leave records, or knowingly making any false official statement.

d. Willfully or negligently damaging or destroying Office property.
e. Theft or unauthorized removal of Office records or county or employee property.
f. Acts of physical violence or fighting (except official police actions).
g. Violating safety rules where there is a threat to life. This includes vehicle

accidents wherein the employee was found to have acted recklessly or with
gross negligence, or in violation of Office policy.

h. Sleeping on duty.
i. Participating in any kind of work slowdown or sit-down or any other concerted

interference with town/county operations.

j. Unauthorized possession or use of firearms, dangerous weapons, or explosives.

ADMINISTRATION
4-08 Employee Discipline
 

k. Threatening or coercing employees or supervisors.
l. Criminal convictions for acts of conduct occurring on or off the job, which are

plainly related to job performance, and consequently to continue the employee in
the assigned position would constitute negligence regarding the agency's duties
to the public.

m.Failure to take physical or mental examinations as required. 
n. Using public office for private gain.
o. Engaging in criminal conduct on or off the job.
p. Engaging in dishonest or immoral conduct that undermines the effectiveness of

t. Manifesting cowardice, feigning illness, or otherwise attempting to shirk official

duty.

u. Involvement in any compromise between persons accused of crime and the

person or persons who may have suffered from criminal acts with the purpose of
allowing the accused to escape punishment.

v. Failure to answer questions specifically directed and related to official duties or

job fitness (unless criminal prosecution is contemplated).

w.The use of unnecessary force during an arrest/custody procedure. 

5. Category III offenses include acts of such severity as to merit suspension or dismissal

at a single occurrence.  

B.  Probationary employees

Probationary employees shall be dismissed, suspended, or otherwise disciplined
according to the foregoing.  In the case of a dismissed probationary employee, the official
record shall merely indicate that the person was dismissed during probationary

Employees found to have engaged in discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, political affiliation, handicap, age, or sex (including sexual harassment)
may be counseled or disciplined with a Category I, II, or III Offense, depending upon the
specific facts and circumstances surrounding the incident.

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY
The office will competently and impartially investigate all allegations of misfeasance,
malfeasance, nonfeasance by all appointees and complaints bearing on the office’s
response to community needs.  

PURPOSE
To describe procedures for making complaints against office personnel, for investigating
complaints, and to list and define the dispositions of complaints.  

PROCEDURES – GENERAL
A.  Receipt of complaints

All written complaints shall be received courteously and shall be handled efficiently. All
deputies are obligated to explain complaint procedures to inquiring citizens.

B.  How to make a complaint

A copy of “How to Make A Complaint” may be given to any citizen requesting information.
A copy of “How to Make a Complaint” will be posted in the public area of the Sheriff’s
Office.

C.  Responsibility for handling complaints

The Sheriff or the next in command shall determine investigative responsibility of
complaints involving how law enforcement service is provided or a failure to provide
service or improper attitudes or behavior.  The Sheriff will oversee all investigations of
complaints and will assign them to the appropriate division when necessary.  The Sheriff
may ask another agency to undertake the investigation.

D.  Complaint-handling procedures

Every effort shall be made to facilitate the convenient, courteous, and prompt receipt and
processing of citizen complaints. An appointee of the Sheriff’s Office who interferes with,
discourages, or delays the making of complaint shall be subject to disciplinary action.  A
copy of the allegation(s) will be provided to the employee as requested.  

E.   Disposition of complaints generally

The Sheriff shall:

Page  102

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-09 Internal Affairs  
 

1.  Notify the complainant, as soon as practical, that the office acknowledges receipt of

the complaint, that it is under investigation, and that the complainant will be advised of
the outcome.  

2.  Notify the employee being investigated of the status/disposition of the complaint. 

Take appropriate disciplinary action following the investigation.

F.  Disposition of serious complaint

1.  Allegations of misconduct that might result in discharge, suspension, or demotion, or
criminal charges being sought are serious complaints.  The term "serious complaint,"
in this manual, is synonymous with "internal investigation." Internal investigations
examine alleged brutality, gross excesses of legal authority, or allegations involving
supervisory or multiple personnel.

2.  In these cases, The Sheriff shall:

investigations of appointees.

a.  Record, register, control or cause to be recorded, registered, or controlled the

b.  Supervise the activities under "a."

Two types of investigations may take place: administrative or criminal.  

A.  Interview for administrative purposes  
In an interview for administrative purpose, no Miranda rights are required.

B.  Interviews for criminal investigative purposes  

1.

If the Sheriff believes that criminal prosecutions are possible and wishes to use
statements against the appointee in a criminal proceeding, or at least wishes to
maintain the option of their use, he or another interviewer shall give the appointee
Miranda rights.

2.

If the appointee decides to answer questions at this point, the responses may be used
in both criminal and disciplinary proceedings.

C.  Individual Responsibility

All appointees of the Sheriff’s Office shall cooperate fully with the appointee conducting
such investigations.  Any appointee of this office shall, upon request,  furnish information
to any citizen regarding the procedures used to file complaints.

D.  Investigation

1. The Sheriff may appoint a designee to investigate the following complaints:

   The following categories of offenses are listed in the Employee Discipline Policy:

a. Category I, 
b. Category II, and 
c. Category III

employed elsewhere while working for our agency.

PROCEDURE
A.  Approval

1.  Any employee desiring to engage in off-duty and/or extra-duty employment shall
submit a request form to the Sheriff.  A response to the request stating either the

request cancellation of a subordinate's outside employment approval when the
secondary employment interferes with either the subordinate's attendance or
performance of duties at the Sheriff's Office.  The approval for outside employment
shall not relieve any employee of the Office from the responsibility to be available and
respond to a call for active duty.

4.  A request for outside employment will be denied or revoked under any of the

following conditions:

a. When the secondary employment or the place where it is performed would tend

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY
The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is found in the Code of Virginia; Section
2.1-340. The FOIA covers both public records and meetings

PURPOSE
To address frequently asked questions and requests from the media and the public.

PROCEDURE
A. Request for Information:

1.

In some instances, a verbal request for information for a single record or limited
information can be promptly fulfilled.  

I.

II.

III.

2.

If a written or verbal request for information is received, it shall be treated as a formal
request, this means an initial response must be made within 5 working days after the
request is received. There must be one of the following responses to the requester:

a. Make the requested record(s) available;
b. Decline in writing to furnish record(s), citing the specific part of the FOIA which

exempt them or any other statute which prohibits their release;
1. Example:  Section 16-301, which restricts the release of juvenile records.

c. If only a portion of the records requested are exempt from disclosure, delete or

excise the portion which need not be disclosed, and make the rest available
accompanied by a written statement identifying that portion of FOIA or other
statute that allows the exemption;

d. Respond in writing that the requested records cannot be identified within 5

working days, thereby allowing an additional 7 days to identify the records and
respond to the request.  

e. In highly unusual circumstances, a petition may be made to the circuit court for
even more time to respond, if accommodation cannot be reached between the
agency and the requester.

3. An agency may recover from the request or actual costs associated with producing

requested records, such as the direct costs for copying or for time spent on
researching and locating records.  For many of the requests received by law
enforcement agencies such costs may be minimized and may be waived in the

Page  110

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-12 Freedom of Information 
 

interests of public relations and an informed citizenry. In the event that the estimated
cost of producing the requested records exceeds $200, the agency may request
payment in advance of processing the request.  Actual costs means the actual cost
per page of photocopying or the hourly pay rate of any staff member involved; there
can be no charge for “overhead,” such as electricity, building maintenance, etc.

4. FOIA does not provide for “standing requests,” as for all future “criminal incident

information” reports an agency may produce.  FOIA can be applied only to records 
that already are in existence.

5. Persons incarcerated in either a state or federal correctional facility cannot request
records under FOIA, but do retain the right to call for records which may be used as
evidence in criminal prosecution in which they are involved.

6. FOIA does not require an agency to produce a new document if the requested

information is not recorded.  However, if adapting an existing document can fulfill the
request it must be done.  Examples would include making available selected fields
from computerized data or readapting information from existing reports written to
comply with requests for “critical incident information.”

B.  CRIMINAL INCIDENT INFORMATION

1.  Required Components

a. Critical incident information is the bulk of FOIA requests, both by media and
citizens. As defined in the FOIA, this is minimal information about an event,
frequently much less than an agency would typically disclose. For example,
suspect descriptions, which are commonly made public in such cases as robbery,
are not required components of “criminal incident information.” 
b. Following is a discussion of each of the required components.

1) “General description of the criminal activity reported”: This means the nature of
the offense, through the specific criminal charge that may be involved need not
be specified.  For example, “sexual assault” may be used rather than the more
specific terms of rape, sodomy, sexual battery, and similar offenses.  “Drug law
violation” could be used without specifying the substance involved or whether
the case involved possession or distribution.

2) “The date and general location the alleged crime was committed”: A specific

date should be generally provided, though in some cases a time frame may be
appropriate.  While the approximate time an event occurred is not required, it
may be provided.  Street and hundred blocks is one of the most frequently used
methods of identifying location.  However, if a street or block contains only
several residences or buildings, use a geographic, community, or subdivision
locator identity.

3) “Identity of the investigating officer”:  Self-explanatory, but could include either
officer taking the report or a detective assigned to follow up on a case.  While
this information must be furnished if a requester wants it. 

4) Is not needed as long as there is a point of contact for additional information,

such as a public information officer (Captain of Detectives).

5) “A general description of any injuries suffered or property damaged or stolen”:
Phrases such as “stab wound”, “Life-threatening injuries”, or “injuries that were
not life threatening” are appropriate.  Property may be described in such terms
as “construction materials”, “household goods”, or “assorted merchandise”.

Page  111

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-12 Freedom of Information 
 

c.  Even this minimal amount of information may be withheld if one or more of the

following circumstances apply should be released:
1) Jeopardize an ongoing investigation or prosecution;
2) Jeopardize the safety of an individual;
3) Cause a suspect to flee or evade detection;
4) Result in the destruction of evidence.

d.  It is important to note that the “criminal incident information” may be withheld only

until the specified damage is no longer likely to occur from the release of the
information. 

e.  The act also states that nothing in the exemption section should be construed to

prohibit the release of information of those portions of “criminal  incident
information” that are not likely to cause the specified damage.

C.  ARREST RECORDS

With the exception of juvenile offenders, the identities of persons arrested, the charges
against them, and the status of the charge or arrest must be released without exception.
This applies to felony, misdemeanor, and traffic arrests.  Any chronological listing of adult
arrests is a public document.  However, the Code of Virginia, reflecting federal
mandates, prohibits the dissemination of criminal history record information outside the
law enforcement community by law enforcement agencies.  Thus, the release of arrest
information is commonly understood to apply to “reasonably contemporaneous” arrests.
Requesters seeking older information may be advised to check court records, which are
public.

D.  ARRESTEE PHOTOGRAPHS

1.

2.

4.

It is required that photographs of adults who are arrested be released if doing so will
not jeopardize an investigation.  For example, a photograph may be withheld if the
person is to appear in a photo or live lineup to avoid possible tainting of the process.
However, once these activities are concluded, the photo must be released.  
If several agencies are involved in an investigation, coordination is essential to insure
that the release of a photo by one agency does not jeopardize the investigation of
another agency.  

3. There are no requirements in FOIA relating to size or quality of adult arrestee

photographs.  
It is important to note that the requirement to release applies to all arrestee who are
photographed, regardless of whether they are charged with a felony or a
misdemeanor.  

5. Unprocessed film does not constitute an existing record and the requirement does not

apply until the photograph has been developed and printed.

E.   PROTECTED INFORMATION
1.  Exemptions from Disclosure

a. FOIA provides law enforcement agencies considerable leeway in protecting

individuals with whom they may be involved in a variety of ways.  The identities of
victims, witnesses, or undercover officers need not be disclosed, but may be at the
discretion of the agency unless otherwise prohibited by law.  Identities of persons
providing information about a crime or criminal activity under any promise of
anonymity (such as through a Crime Solvers program) will not be disclosed. 
Records pertaining to neighborhood watch programs, including information

Page  112

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-12 Freedom of Information 
 

pertaining to individual participants, are exempt from disclosure.

b.  Also exempt from mandatory disclosure is information that reveals investigative

techniques or procedures, though an agency has the option to disclose if it desires.
Records of reports to state and local law enforcement agencies and campus police
departments of colleges and universities need not be disclosed.

2.  Criminal Investigations

a. This information enjoys extensive protection.  Exempt from disclosure are all
complaints, memoranda, correspondence, and relating evidence relating to a
criminal investigation (except for “criminal incident information” relating to felonies).
Commonwealth’s attorneys are specifically defined as law enforcement officials, so
criminal investigative materials remain protected when they are turned over to a
prosecutor by a law enforcement agency.  

b. Once again, it is important to note that a law enforcement agency has the
discretion to release materials at any time, even though FOIA extends the
exemption to disclosure in perpetuity.  In many cases it will be deemed essential to
withhold portions of investigative reports even after a case has been adjudicated. 
On the other hand, there may be portions of some case investigations that would
be in the public interest to eventually disclose.  FOIA leaves that decision up to the
law enforcement agency.

F.   OTHER INVESTIGATIONS AND RECORDS

1.   Exemptions to Disclosure

a. While stating that all records kept by law enforcement agencies as required under
Section 15.2-1722 (Certain Records to Be Kept By Police Chiefs and Sheriffs) shall
be subject to FOIA, there are some broad exemptions in furtherance of law
enforcement purposes.  The one with the most wide-ranging applicability relates to
noncriminal incident or other investigative reports or materials.  These portions
containing identifying information of a personal, medical, or financial nature where
the release of such information could jeopardize the safety or privacy of any
person are exempted from disclosure.  This is a very broad exemption that
requires judicious application to avoid accusations of abuse through overly broad
application. 
 Examples of information that can and should be protected under this exemption
are:
1) Reports of suicide attempts;
2) Medical information obtained during unattended death investigations;
3) Credit card numbers;
4) Other information recorded on lost property reports; 
5) Response to domestic disputes, in which no violence occurs.

b.

c. Radio and phone recordings are not wholly exempted under the law.  While those
involving criminal investigations are wholly protected, these involving non-criminal
incidents are only to the extent described above.  For example, the words of a
caller reporting a medical emergency could be excised from a recording (or deleted
from a transcript) in order to protect individual privacy, but many words of the
call-taker or dispatcher would be subject to release, as would such related records
as response time.

d. Exemptions are provided for:

1) Records of background investigations of applicants for law enforcement agency

employment or other confidential administrative investigations, examples of

Page  113

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-12 Freedom of Information 
 

which include internal affairs investigations or background checks for
conservators of the peace;

2) Those portions of any records containing plans for or resources dedicated to
undercover operations, for example, unmarked undercover vehicles could be
excluded from the agency’s fleet roster, which would otherwise be released.

3) Personnel records, with the exception of salaries over $10,000, and personnel

disciplinary actions are exempted from disclosure.

e. Other records in the possession of a law enforcement agency, as well as

correspondence, not falling into any type of the previously discussed exempted
categories, are subject to disclosure.  This also applies to electronic messages. 
For example, an e-mail from a police chief to a deputy chief inquiring about certain
aspects of a homicide investigation would be exempt from disclosure as criminal
investigative materials. However, an e-mail from the chief to the deputy chief
making unkind comments about the major would be subject to release under FOIA
(and possibly be the subject of a headline in the local newspaper!).

2.  Other Exemptions

a. FOIA contains several other specific exemptions applicable to or of interest to law
enforcement agencies in addition to those enumerated in Section 2.1-342.2 Found
in Section 2.1-342.01,

b. Examples include:  

1) Engineering and architectural drawings;
2) Operational, procedural, tactical planning or training manuals; Staff meeting

minutes or other records which would reveal surveillance techniques, personnel
deployments, alarm system technologies, or operational or transportation 

3) Plans or procedures when disclosure would jeopardize the security or employee

safety of any courthouse, jail, or law enforcement facility.

4) Law enforcement agency records containing specific tactical plans when their

disclosure would jeopardize the safety or security of law enforcement personnel
or the general public.  Also included in this exemption are:
a) Records of emergency services containing specific tactical plans related to

anti-terrorist activity.

b) Any information describing the design, function, operation or access control

features of any security system used to control access to or use of any
automated data processing or telecommunication system.

c) Information and records acquired during a review of any child death by the

State Child Fatality Review Team.

d) Confidential records, including victim identity, provided to staff of a rape crisis

center or a program for battered spouses.

e) Computer programs used to process data that may be included within official

records.

G.  INSURING COMPLIANCE

Because of the specific knowledge required and the broad discretion granted to law
enforcement agencies, not all personnel of an agency can respond to requests for
information.   Records secretaries, all administrative personnel, and all supervisor
personnel should be knowledgeable of the FOIA requirements.  Prompt, polite referral of
the requestor to the persons who can help them is mandatory.  The Sheriff or his
designee is the designated point of contact within the agency to handle third party
requests for information.

H.  CONCLUSION

The underlying principle of FOIA is that the public has the right of access to the public’s
business.  Law enforcement activities must be, of necessity, one of the very few areas
where that right of access must be limited.  The Virginia FOIA, as amended, does this
quite effectively to insure accomplishment of the law enforcement mission.  Nonetheless,
law enforcement agencies have an obligation to responsibly make available to the public,
whether represented by a private citizen or a news media reported, not only that
information mandated as releasable by FOIA, but also additional information which will
serve to enhance the public’s understanding of the agency and its work. 

CODE OF VIRGINIA 2.2-3706. Disclosure of criminal records; limitations. 

A. As used in this section: 

"Criminal incident information" means a general description of the criminal activity
reported, the date and general location the alleged crime was committed, the identity of
the investigating officer, and a general description of any injuries suffered or property
damaged or stolen. 

B. Law-enforcement agencies shall make available upon request criminal incident

information relating to felony offenses. However, where the release of criminal incident
information is likely to jeopardize an ongoing investigation or prosecution, or the safety of
an individual; cause a suspect to flee or evade detection; or result in the destruction of
evidence, such information may be withheld until the above-referenced damage is no
longer likely to occur from release of the information. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the release of those portions of such information that are not likely
to cause the above-referenced damage. 

C. Information in the custody of law-enforcement agencies relative to the identity of any

individual, other than a juvenile, who is arrested and charged, and the status of the
charge or arrest shall be released. 

D. The identity of any victim, witness or undercover officer, or investigative techniques or
procedures need not but may be disclosed unless disclosure is prohibited or restricted
under Code of Virginia 19.2-11.2. 

E. The identity of any individual providing information about a crime or criminal activity under

a promise of anonymity shall not be disclosed. 

F. The following records are excluded from the provisions of this chapter, but may be

disclosed by the custodian, in his discretion, except where such disclosure is prohibited
by law: 
1. Complaints, memoranda, correspondence, case files or reports, witness statements,
and evidence relating to a criminal investigation or prosecution, other than criminal
incident information as defined in subsection A; 

2. Adult arrestee photographs when necessary to avoid jeopardizing an investigation in

felony cases until such time as the release of the photograph will no longer jeopardize
the investigation; 

3. Reports submitted in confidence to (i) state and local law-enforcement agencies, (ii)

investigators authorized pursuant to Code of Virginia 53.1-16 or 66-3.1, and (iii)
campus police departments of public institutions of higher education established
pursuant to Chapter 17 (Code of Virginia 23-232 et seq.) of Title 23; 

4. Portions of records of local government crime commissions that would identify

individuals providing information about crimes or criminal activities under a promise of
anonymity; 

Page  115

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-12 Freedom of Information 
 

5. Records of local law-enforcement agencies relating to neighborhood watch programs
that include the names, addresses, and operating schedules of individual participants
in the program that are provided to such agencies under a promise of anonymity; 

6. All records of persons imprisoned in penal institutions in the Commonwealth provided

such records relate to the imprisonment; 

7. Records of law-enforcement agencies, to the extent that such records contain specific

tactical plans, the disclosure of which would jeopardize the safety or security of

6. "Predominant physical aggressor" (See Virginia Code 19.2-81.4) is the party that

poses the greatest threat.  The predominant physical aggressor is not necessarily the
first disputant to engage in aggressive behavior, but the one with the most ability and
inclination to inflict physical injury. Deputies shall identify a predominant physical
aggressor based on the totality of the circumstances. 

7.  "Domestic violence shelters/programs" means services that are provided (usually 24
hours a day) for women and their children who have been physically or emotionally
abused, or who have been threatened with abuse by their spouses or partners. 
Services include crisis intervention, counseling, shelter, escort to court, food, clothing,
and transportation.

8.  "Protective order" is a court order of protection on behalf of an abused

family/household member that restrains the abuser from further acts of          
violence, and may order the abuser to refrain from further contact, vacate the
residence, relinquish custody of a vehicle, plus other measures (see    Virginia Code
16.1-279.1).  A protective order may be valid up to two years.  Officers must be aware
of two types of protective orders:
a. An Emergency Protective Order (see Virginia Code 16.1-253.4) may be requested

by an Officer by telephone or in person (or by an allegedly abused individual in

Page  131

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-19 Domestic Violence  
 

person) from a judge or a magistrate.  The Emergency Protective Order aims to
protect the health or safety of any person.  It must be put in writing as soon as
possible by the officer on Form DC-626.  This order expires seventy-two hours
after issuance.  If the expiration of the seventy-two-hour period occurs at a time
that the court is not in session, the emergency protective order shall be extended
until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day that the Juvenile and Domestic Relations
District Court is in session.

b. Officers may request an Emergency Protective Order pursuant to the code section

if the person in need of protection is physically or mentally incapable of filing a
petition pursuant to Virginia Code 16.1-253.1 or 16.1-279.1.  Officers may request
the extension of an emergency protective order for an additional period of time not
to exceed seventy-two hours after expiration of the original order.  The request for
an order or extension of an order may be made orally, in person or by electronic
means, and the judge of a circuit court, general district court, or juvenile and
domestic relations district court or a magistrate may issue an oral Emergency
Protective order.  An oral Emergency Protective Order issued pursuant to this
section shall be reduced to writing by the Officer requesting the order or the
magistrate on Form DC-626.  The completed form shall include a statement of the
grounds for the order asserted by the officer or the allegedly abused person.

c. When the magistrate or the Officer, on behalf of the magistrate, issues an

Emergency Protective Order, the following information must be obtained, if at all
possible, at the time of issue:
1) Name
2) Sex
3) Race
4) DOB
5) Height
6) Weight
7) Eye Color
8) Hair Color
9) Social Security Number

c. Officers must serve a copy of this order on the respondent, and give a copy to the

abused  family/household member.  The officer must forward the original to the
issuing judge or magistrate for verification, who then has it filed with the Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Court within five days of issuance.

d. All Emergency Protective Orders must be entered in the VCIN Computer as a civil

paper before service or as soon as possible after service.  VCIN entries will be
accomplished at the 911 Communications Center.  Office personnel are
responsible for entering all EPO’s received during business hours and sending a
copy to the 911 Communications Center for entry into VCIN. After business hours
officers are responsible for faxing a copy of the EPO to dispatch, for entry into
VCIN and for making a copy for entry into the computer system. Upon service, the
officers must ensure that the VCIN entry is modified to show date and time of
service.  VCIN entries will be accomplished as explained above. 

 

III.

PATROL RESPONSIBILITIES

A.  ARRIVAL AT SCENE

1.  Obtain all available information from the dispatcher prior to arrival.

Page  132

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-19 Domestic Violence  
 

2.  Approaching the scene.

a.  Officers must be concerned for their own safety as well as the disputants.  When
possible, Officers should wait for back up, discuss a strategy, and approach the
dispute scene in pairs.

b.  Avoid use of sirens and alarms in the vicinity of the scene. The assailant might be

dangerous and could turn a weapon upon arriving officers;

c.  Observe the location of the dispute before contacting the complainant.  Consider

the surroundings.  Park the marked car a short distance away.  Each officer should
follow a separate approach to the scene of the dispute, maintaining maximum
cover and escape route.  From this point on, officers should remain within sight of
one another, if possible.

d.  Before knocking on the door, listen and look in any nearby window to obtain

additional information about the situation (e.g., layout of the house, number of
people, weapons, evidence of violence or damage).

e.  To minimize possibility of injury, stand to the side of the door when knocking.  The

unexpected may occur when the door opens.

3.  Initial contact with occupant(s). 

a.  Identify self by name, give an explanation of your presence, and request entry into
the home (when conditions permit).  Ascertain identity of complainant, and ask to
see him or her and any other person at the home.
1) Officers shall not accept statements from any disputant or witness that the call

was a mistake without investigating further.

2) Officers shall not leave without interviewing the complainant.

b.  If entry is refused, Officers must explain that they must make sure there are no

injured persons inside.  If no one responds to knocking, try to establish voice
contact by shouting for an answer.

c.  Refusal of entry or no response to a knock at the door may require a forced

entrance only if Officers have a reasonable suspicion that the safety of people
inside may be in jeopardy. In making the decision to make a forced warrantless
entry, officers shall evaluate the following elements: 
1) the degree of urgency involved and the time required to get a warrant; 
2) the possibility of danger to others, including officer left to guard the site; 
3) whether the suspected offense involved violence; 
4) whether officers reasonably believe that persons may be armed.

d.  Officers may conduct a search of the premises if consent has been given to do so. 

Although a consent search eliminates the need for a warrant and for probable
cause, such consent must be freely and voluntarily given.  If two people have joint
ownership or possession of a place or thing, either one may give a valid consent.
1)  A spouse can consent to the search of premises used jointly by both husband
and wife.  This also applies if the man and woman are unmarried cohabitants. 

2)  2 If one of them exercises sole control over part of the premises, the other

cannot give valid consent to search that part.

e.  Once inside, establish control by:

1) Inquiring about the nature of the dispute;
2) Identifying disputants; determine if EMS services are needed
3) Being aware of potential weapons in surroundings; avoid, if practical, conducting

interviews in rooms where potential weapons are usually stored such as a
kitchen, den, bedroom, etc.

4) Determining if persons are in other rooms, whether children or adults, and the

Page  133

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual

extent of any injuries.  These persons should be separated from the parties
involved and kept out of hearing range (so their status as possible witnesses
won't be compromised).

5) Protecting the victim from further abuse.  Separate the victim from the assailant
and arrange for medical attention if victim is hurt.  If the victim appears injured
and yet refuses medical assistance, carefully document any observed injuries,
as well as the refusal of medical treatment.  Photograph the victim's injuries

6) Ascertaining whether a protective order has been violated.

f.  If weapons (whether firearms, knives, or any other object which could be used as a

weapon) are present, secure them away from the disputants, if practicable, while
the disputants are being interviewed.  

B. INTERVIEWING ALL DISPUTANTS

1. Ensure safety and privacy interviewing the victim in a place separate from the

assailant.

2. Ascertain the following information from the victim:

a. What happened;
b. Any injuries, who caused them, and what weapons or objects were used;
c. Relationship to assailant;
d. Any threats made against victim or others;
e. Forced sexual contact against victim’s will;
f. Any court cases pending against assailant or any protective orders in effect;

decision to arrest is a law enforcement one, and transport securely to the
jail/magistrate.

2.  If an arrest must be made because a protective order has been violated, verify its

validity by:
1) Examining the victim’s copy, if available;
2) Having communications search VCIN or contact the jurisdiction that issued the

order to confirm its currency.

3.  If the assailant is absent, arrange transportation for the victim to a safe shelter or
other appropriate place.  Have dispatch circulate a “be-on-the-lookout” message
describing the assailant and arrange for an arrest warrant

D.  VICTIM SERVICES:

1. Explain to the victim about protective orders and restraining orders and how to obtain

them and offer to help the victim obtain them later.

2. If the victim wants to leave the premises to ensure safety, remain at the scene while

the victim packs essentials.  Advise the victim to take only personal items plus
important papers.  When transportation to a safe house, hospital, or magistrate
arrangements will be made.

3. Give the victim telephone numbers of agencies for future assistance in the area and

Page  134

emergency number, 911.  Assure victim we are available to assist in future
emergencies and explain measures to ensure their future safety.

4.  Provide the victim with a standardized form listing the specific rights afforded to crime

victims.  Per Virginia Code 19.2-11.1.

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY
All possible efforts shall be made to prevent the detonation of explosive devices. A bomb
technician shall be called to the scene as soon as practicable after a device has been found.
A bomb technician shall also be notified of all bomb threats and incidents where an
explosive device has been detonated.  The bomb technician will then determine if a
response to the scene is necessary.

PURPOSE
To assure the uniform, safe and expeditious processing of bomb threats and bomb
incidents, it is necessary to specify the responsibilities of the deputies and how the deputies
shall coordinate their activities with those of other agencies.

I.

II.

III.

PROCEDURES
A.  Receiving the threat:

1. It should be kept in mind that the citizen who received the threat is the key to the
Office’s plan of action. This person should be thoroughly questioned before the
procedure is placed in effect.

2. The deputy should be prepared to ask the citizen who has received or relayed the

threat, the following questions:
a. Where did the individual say the bomb device was located?
b. What time did the individual say the device would explode?
c. What reason or motive did the individual give for placing the bomb?
d. What does the device look like?
e. Did the individual leave a name?
f. Was there any background noise, or speech impediment, accent or manner of

speaking that the recipient could remember?

g. Was the individual calm or excited?
h. What were the exact words used by the individual?

B.  Deputy's responsibility at the scene.

Upon assignment to a bomb threat or the discovery of a suspected bomb, the assigned
deputy should respond to the target location to make an assessment of conditions in the
immediate vicinity and to prevent the situation from worsening (such as the movement of
spectators into the target building) until the arrival of a shift supervisor.

Page  148

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-24 Bomb Threats/Bomb Incidents
 

C. Initial responsibilities of the Shift Supervisor.

1.  Upon notification of the bomb threat, the Shift Supervisor should immediately respond
to the target location as officer-in-charge. After his/her arrival, he/she should make an
assessment of the situation and, if appropriate, should establish a nearby point of
contact or field command post to which other deputies can respond for instructions.
Announcement to our personnel of the location of the contact point or command post
should either be made by land line to the Communications Center or by moving two or
more blocks away from the scene before using the police radio. The officer-in-charge
should set up this post at a reasonable distance away from the threatened building.
All responding personnel must report to this post for assignment. At this time, the
officer-in-charge will notify the Sheriff, Major and Captain. The Virginia State Police
Arson Bureau bomb technicians should be contacted. The Virginia State Police bomb
technician can make a determination, whether a response to the scene is necessary.
However, the Virginia State Police bomb dog or another trained bomb dog can be
summoned to search, when authorized by a shift supervisor.

2.  The officer-in-charge should attempt to establish immediate contact with the person
who is responsible for control of the premises (e.g., the proprietor, owner, manager,
principal). All activity should be coordinated with this individual.

3.  As soon as contact is made with the person responsible for the premises and an

assessment of the situation is made, the deputy in charge should request a decision
as to evacuation and the commencement of search procedures. Once the decisions
have been made, the appropriate procedures as outlined in Section D. will be
implemented.

4.  All communications activity is to be performed by the Field Command Post. Use of

two-way radios within the target area is prohibited until such time as any bomb device
has been located and it has been determined that the detonator cannot be activated
by radio. The target area is defined as the area within a two-block radius of the target
building.

5.  Evacuation Procedure
6.  Unless a device has been located, the person who is responsible for the control of the

threatened building (as defined above) will be required to make the decision to
evacuate or not. If law enforcement advice is sought, it should always be to order
evacuation. If a device has been located, the Sheriff’s Office personnel will, in all
cases, order immediate evacuation. If the threat is within the Courthouse facility,
Courthouse Security shall handle the evacuation and the evacuation shall be
mandatory.

7.  If the evacuation order is to be given, it should be remembered that activation of any

electrical device could set off a bomb. Therefore, any order to evacuate should,
preferably, be given verbally or by a portable public address system and not by a fire
alarm system or other internal system.

8.  The doors and windows in the area of the device should be opened. A fire drill, in

which windows and doors are closed, should not be used as a reason for evacuation.
All persons should be evacuated from above, below and on the immediate sides of
the device. Elevators should not be used.

9.  Sheriff’s Office personnel should be stationed in such a manner that they can prevent

anyone from entering the area.

10. When an evacuation order is given, the Patrol Division Commander should be

notified and should immediately respond to the target location as officer-in-charge.

D. Procedures

Page  149

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-24 Bomb Threats/Bomb Incidents
 

When any suspected explosive device is located:
1.  Do not touch or go near the object once it has been discovered.
2.  Do not turn on or off any lights or allow any flash bulbs or lights to affect the object.
3.  Do not use any type of radio communications within the two- block target area. Any
type of transmission within this area may activate any electrical blasting cap causing
the device to explode.

4.  Evacuate all persons except for sufficient Sheriff’s Office personnel to do the tasks

listed immediately below.
Complete the following tasks:

a.  Station enough Sheriff’s Office personnel to protect the object from disturbance,

but as great a distance as possible while making sure the object is secure.
b.  Contact the bomb technicians of the Virginia State Police through Division
Headquarters, Wytheville, VA. If the State Police bomb technicians are not
available, contact the E.O.D., 57th Ordinance Detachment, at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.
In incidents where hand grenades, artillery shells, or other obvious military items
are found, the 57th Ordinance Detachment should be notified for disposition.

c.  Request from the Communication Center to contact the fire department and have

standby equipment respond, with radio off, within the target area.

d.  Open any doors and windows in the area.

E.  Post-explosion notification.

1.  On scene procedure
If an explosion occurs:

a.  Seal off both the internal and external explosion area to avoid possible personal

injury and minimize contamination of crime scene evidence.

b.  Allow entry only to emergency equipment and personnel or those authorized by the

deputy in charge.

c.  Assume there may be a secondary device, which could be detonated, and if

appropriate, follow the basic procedures mentioned above that are applicable in
the event of a suspected bomb.

2.  Notification procedure
If an explosion occurs:

Services to the scene.

a.  Communications Center personnel should notify the nearest Fire and Rescue

b.  After confirmation, by a deputy on the scene, that an explosion has actually

occurred, the supervisor in charge shall have the communications personnel make
the following notifications;
1)  Sheriff or Major 
2)  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
3)  Virginia State Police Arson Bureau bomb technician
4)  Criminal Investigation Division

F.  Investigative responsibility

The Tazewell County Sheriff's Office will be responsible for security and protection of the
crime scene at an explosion. Crime scene processing and evidence collection will be the
responsibility of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, unless otherwise
requested, who will be assisted by state and local Fire Marshals.

All evidence collected at the crime scene will be processed and analyzed by the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Copies of the laboratory analysis reports will be
provided for the Tazewell County Sheriff's Office, and State Police Arson Bureau. The

Page  150

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-24 Bomb Threats/Bomb Incidents
 

primary responsibility for investigating actual bombing incidents will remain with the
Tazewell County Sheriff's Office. This investigation will be conducted in conjunction with
personnel from ATF and the State Police. If a Federally owned or leased building (except
those owned or leased by the United States Treasury Department) is the target of a
bombing, communications personnel must notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation
instead of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. If the FBI relinquishes jurisdiction in the
incident, communications personnel should then notify the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. Upon initial telephone contact, police communications personnel must
inform ATF of the FBI's decision to relinquish jurisdiction in the incident.

POLICY
Hostage and barricade situations present extreme danger to deputies and citizens. Each
hostage/barricade situation is different, but a basic plan may provide deputies with
guidelines to help defuse the situation safely.   

PURPOSE
To set operational guidelines for the handling of hostage and barricaded person situations.
The safety of deputies, hostages, and innocent bystanders is of paramount concern.   

I.

II.

III.

PROCEDURE

1. First units on the scene:

a. Unless immediate action is necessary to protect life, the first unit(s) on the scene

will confine activities to containment and stabilization of the situation.

b. At the earliest opportunity, advise communications of the situation, giving as much

detail as possible. Communications shall notify the Chain of Command 

c. When sufficient manpower is available at the scene, a perimeter should be

established to prevent the escape of the suspect and keep unauthorized persons
from entering the area.

d. Persons in the immediate vicinity of where the suspect is located should be moved

to a safe area, provided such movement can be accomplished without exposing
the people to danger. Any movement, which exposes people to the suspect’s field
of fire, must be avoided.  Remember, deputies cannot force citizens to evacuate
their homes, they can only request that they do so. 

2.  Notification of Special Response Team

a.  If the necessity for a Special Response Team presents itself, the closest available
Special Response Team will be called.

3. Establishing Command Post; Command at Scene:

a.  As soon as the situation allows, the supervisor on the scene will establish a

Page  152

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
ADMINISTRATION
4-25 Hostage/Barricade Situation 
 

command post for the purpose of coordinating the activities of all units involved.
The supervisor should ensure that the location selected for the command post is in
a safe location. In addition, the ranking supervisor shall ensure that the
communications center has been advised of all necessary information. 

b.  Overall command of the scene will rest with the highest-ranking supervisor on
scene. They will remain in command until a higher-ranking authority dictates
otherwise.  

c. Overall command shall extend to the direction of patrol units and their supervisors

on the scene as well as support units, which may be called for specific duties.
d.  The decision to use deadly force, to employ chemical agents, or to assault a

barricaded position, shall rest with the person in charge or in their absence the on
scene commander. This does not apply to exigent circumstances arising during the
situation requiring immediate action to protect life.

4.  Inner and Outer Perimeters

a. Patrol units may be assigned to control the outer perimeter.
b. A supervisor will ensure that both the inner and outer perimeters are secured.
c. Those personnel assigned control of the outer perimeter will be responsible for the

evacuation of injured victims and bystanders.

5. Fire and Rescue Equipment

It is the policy of the Sheriff’s Office to have fire and rescue units on the scene in a
barricade or hostage situation. Fire and rescue units should respond to the scene in a
non-emergent status unless there are injured persons or fire present. Fire and rescue
units should be staged in an area close to the command post, but out of any danger
area.

6. News Media

Access to the scene and briefings for the news media will be in accordance with
guidelines established in the Release of Information policy.

7. Communication with Suspects

Trained negotiators shall conduct communication with suspects. Negotiators shall
utilize accepted practice and whatever equipment necessary to maintain
communications. All communications with suspects shall be recorded, when possible.
Negotiators shall advise the command post on intelligence gathered, the emotional
condition of the suspect/hostage-takers and hostages, and other relevant information.

All other items may be negotiated for using accepted practices. The first general rule
of negotiating is to always get something in return for something. All items, which are
negotiated for, shall have the concurrence of the Sheriff, the Major, or in their absence
the on scene commander.

10. Mobile Suspects

Generally, it is the policy of the Sheriff's Office not to let hostage takers become
mobile. In some situations, it may be necessary to permit the suspect’s mobility. When
it becomes apparent that this may occur, the following provisions shall be made:
a. Chase/Surveillance: Vehicles shall be assigned to maintain surveillance on the

suspect’s vehicle. The surveillance may be direct or discreet, depending on
circumstances and requirements. All necessary surveillance equipment shall be at
the scene prior to allowing the suspects' mobility, if possible.  In addition, a
secreted electronic transmitter, if available, shall be placed on the vehicle to allow
the vehicles location to be pinpointed when the situation demands a discreet
surveillance.

b. Control of travel routes:  Depending on the situation, it may be necessary to block

all exits from a planned travel route. This should be accomplished by blocking side
streets with vehicles to prevent the suspect from leaving the route and prevent
innocent citizens from wandering into a dangerous situation.  If at all possible, a
preplanned route should be agreed upon by the Sheriff's Office and the hostage
taker.  The decision to utilize escort vehicles to help ensure safety shall be the
decision of the Sheriff or his designee.

11. De-escalation

Once the hostage taker has been captured, the following actions shall be performed:
a. The suspect shall be removed from the scene immediately in a screened unit following

an extensive search of his or her person incident to an arrest. The investigating
deputy shall take the suspect to a place of interrogation.

b. Hostages shall be removed immediately upon capture of the suspect.

1) The on-scene supervisor shall alert all participants by radio that the hostages are

on-duty supervisor.

3) Investigations shall be made into any surrounding property damage, e.g., bullet

holes in neighboring building or destroyed lawns and gardens. Investigations shall
include pictures.

12. After action reports

The on-duty supervisor shall submit a comprehensive report to the Chain of Command
on all hostage/ barricade incidents.

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of

POLICY

discredit to the employee, the Office, or the county.

PURPOSE
An appointee of this office is the most conspicuous representative of government, and to the
majority of the people a symbol of stability and authority upon whom they can rely. The
conduct of a member or an employee is closely scrutinized, and when actions are found to
be excessive, unwarranted or unjustified they are criticized far more severely than
comparable conduct of persons in other walks of life.

PROCEDURE
GENERAL
1.  CONFLICT OF ORDERS / LAWS To permit effective supervision, direction, and control,

employees should promptly obey any lawful order of a superior, including any order
relayed from a superior by an employee of the same or lesser rank. In the event an
employee is given two apparently lawful but different orders that may be in conflict, the
last order given should be complied with unless the order is retracted or modified. In the
event an employee receives conflicting orders, the employee should inform the person
giving the last order of the conflict of orders. That person giving the conflicting order
should then resolve the conflict by either retracting, modifying or requesting the employee
to comply with the latest order. In the event the conflicting order is not altered or
retracted, the employee will not be held responsible for disobedience of the order or
directive previously issued. Employees of the Sheriff's Office are not required to obey any
order which is contrary to the laws of the United States, Commonwealth of Virginia, or
ordinances of the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office. However, such refusal to obey is the
responsibility of the employee and he will be required to justify his action.

2.  IMMORAL CONDUCT-Appointees shall maintain a level of moral conduct in their

personal and business affairs which is in keeping with the highest standards of the law
enforcement profession. Deputies shall not participate in any incident involving moral
turpitude that impairs their ability to perform as law enforcement officers or causes the
Office to be brought into disrepute. All sworn deputies shall sign and abide by the Law
Enforcement Code of Ethics.

ADMINISTRATION
4-29 Rules of Conduct 
 

3.  CONFORMANCE TO LAWS-Appointees shall obey all laws of the United States and of

any State and local jurisdiction in which they are present. A conviction of any law shall be
prima facie evidence of a violation of this action.

4.  REPORTING FOR DUTY-Appointees shall report for duty at the time and place required

by assignment or orders and shall be physically and mentally fit to perform their duties.
They shall be properly equipped and cognizant of information required for the proper
performance of duty so that they may immediately assume their duties. Judicial
subpoenas shall constitute an order to report for duty under this Section.

5.  NEGLECT OF DUTY-Appointees shall not read, play games, watch television or movies

or otherwise engage in entertainment while on duty, except as may be required in the
performance of duty. They shall not engage in any activities or personal business that
would cause them to neglect or be inattentive to duty.

injury, falsely report themselves ill or injured, or otherwise deceive or attempt to deceive
any official of the Office as to the condition of their health.

they shall so report to their Supervisor, who shall determine the proper course of action.

of duty except when authorized by proper authority.

9.  MEALS-Appointees shall be permitted to suspend assigned activity, subject to immediate
call at all times, for the purpose of having meals during their tour of duty. Appointees are
encouraged to take no longer than 30 minutes for meals, and no more than two (2) patrol
deputies should eat at any given location at any given time. Patrol deputies will advise
communications by radio when they are out of service for a meal on all shifts and give
their location.

10. UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE-Appointees shall maintain sufficient competency

to properly perform their duties and assume the responsibilities of their positions.
Appointees shall perform their duties in a manner that will maintain the highest standards
of efficiency in carrying out the functions and objectives of the Office. Unsatisfactory
performance may be demonstrated by:
a. a lack of knowledge concerning the application of laws required to be enforced; 
b. an unwillingness or inability to perform assigned tasks; 
c. the failure to conform to work standards established for the deputy's rank, grade, or

position; 

d. the failure to take appropriate action on the occasion of a crime, disorder, or other

condition deserving law enforcement attention; or absence without leave.

e. In addition to other indicators or unsatisfactory performance, the following will be
considered prima facie evidence of unsatisfactory performance; repeated poor

codes.

1. Utilization of emergency equipment during response will be in compliance with state

2. The first unit to arrive at the scene of an alarm will approach the premises carefully,
being observant for lookouts, getaway cars, etc., and will take up a position to cover
the entrance without being seen from inside, unless it has been determined that the
suspects have left. If it has been determined that the suspects have left, the unit will
enter and obtain information for radio lookout if the premises are occupied.

3. The first backup unit to arrive at the scene will take up a position to cover the second

most likely exit. Unless the suspects are known to have left, the backup unit will
attempt to position himself to avoid being seen from within the protected premises.
The backup unit will advise the Communication Center as soon as he is in position,
and will remain alert for suspects acting as lookouts and for getaway vehicles, etc.

In cases of a verified alarm, all other patrol units will proceed as follows until given
other assignments or instructed to resume normal patrol activity.

a. Patrol units not dispatched to, but near the scene of the alarm, will begin moving

toward positions from which to observe possible escape routes or areas where
suspects might switch vehicles.

b. Upon confirmation of an alarm, distant patrol units not otherwise engaged in

cases warranting their immediate attention will proceed to the closest point which
will afford the opportunity to observe an escape route or effect interception of
fleeing suspects.

B.  BANK ALARMS

1. Upon receipt of a bank alarm, the “Closest Car” strategy will be applied; i.e.

communication will inquire if a unit is in the vicinity of the bank in question and if so,
that unit will be assigned along with a back-up unit. The first unit on the scene will
take control of the situation and direct other units as to routes of approach.

2. All cars dispatched will be alert for suspicious persons and/or vehicles fleeing the

scenes; all cars not dispatched will be on standby for possible fleeing vehicles in their
respective areas.

3.

4.

In approaching the scene:
a. Emergency lights and siren will not be used unless traffic conditions or unusual

circumstances dictate otherwise-based upon the discretion of the responding
deputy and his assessment of the situation. If emergency lights and siren are
necessary to expedite the approach to the bank, they will be turned off at a point
where the siren cannot be heard nor the emergency lights seen from the bank’s
location.

b. Units will attempt to arrive at the same time, and if feasible, approach from

different angles, and observe the scene for a short period of time for possible
lookouts, getaway cars, or other suspicious circumstances.

c. Police vehicles will be parked at a reasonable distance from the scene and, if

possible, out of view of the bank. The vehicle is to be secured prior to the officer’s
approach on foot. The distance the police vehicle should be parked from the bank
will depend on the location of the bank and approach routes.

d. The first unit on the scene will not approach the bank on foot until the back-up

units arrive, and then the approach will be conducted on a cautious, coordinated
effort using all available cover to protect from high powered rifles and other
weaponry. However, the first unit on the scene will observe the bank for unusual
circumstances and provide additional information if necessary, in addition to
direction routes of approach to assigned units.

If the responding unit does not observe a  recognized bank employee standing
outside the building, the supervisor will direct communications to telephone the bank.
If there is no answer or communications detects unusual circumstances during the
course of the telephone call, it will be assumed that a bank robbery is in progress and
the following course of action will be followed:
a. The perimeter of the building will be secured, and the Shift Supervisor may request

b.

additional units for assistance.
If necessary, thoroughfares will be blocked and traffic detoured away from the
bank. The local fire and rescue apparatus will be notified of the situation.

5. When all units have arrived at the scene:

a. Back-up units and/or supervisor will approach the bank with service weapons in
hand and ready. The assigned unit will also utilize their service weapon (except
where unusual circumstances warrant the use of the shotgun).  

Note:  If the Shift Supervisor determines that one unit should remain mobile for pursuit
purposes, he shall appoint a unit for this purpose.

b. The bank will be approached on foot taking care to avoid a cross-fire situation.
c. Back-up units will be directed to cover the most likely escape routes. 

Page  189

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-02 Response to Alarms
 

d. License numbers of suspicious or suspect vehicles along with a description of

each will be relayed by radio to communications.

e. When approaching the bank, officers will observe if a crime is still in progress.
f. Under no circumstances (except to protect life) will the bank be entered by units

on the scene.

If during the initial approach of the bank the unit observes the bank official standing
outside the bank, caution and observation of the bank will continue until the unit
verifies that a bank robbery is not in progress. The deputy is not to advance to the
bank official’s location. The deputy will motion for the bank official to come to him.

If the unit observes a crime in progress as suspect(s) are exiting the bank, the
following procedures are used:
a.

If not seen by the suspect(s), the unit is to wait for the suspect(s) to clear the
doorway and building, allowing the bank official to lock the doorway; and then
attempt to contact suspect(s) and order them to surrender after all units are in
position.
If the officer has been seen by the suspect(s), the unit should obtain cover; i.e.
automobile, etc., and attempt to contact and order suspect(s) to surrender. The
unit is to take no risks, which would endanger innocent persons or other deputies.
If the suspect(s) return to the interior of the bank before the doors can be locked, a
hostage situation will exist and the Special Response Team and Negotiators will be
needed.
If the suspect(s) are observed fleeing the scene in a vehicle after a confirmed bank
robbery has occurred:
1) At least one unit will continue to the scene of the bank robbery to:

a) Check for casualties
b) Preserve the crime scene
c) Detain witnesses
d) Obtain descriptions of the suspect(s) and suspect vehicle
e) Ascertain other pertinent information and complete the necessary report.
2) Attempts will be made by other unit(s) to follow the suspect vehicle, obtaining

the license number, vehicle description, and other valuable information.
However, a single unit will not attempt to apprehend until a back-up unit has
arrived or has been strategically located at a predetermined location for the
stopping of the suspect vehicle.

3) When at least two units are in close pursuit of the suspect vehicle, efforts will be
made to stop the suspect vehicle in a relatively “safe” location, i.e. away from a
congested area where traffic and pedestrians are prevalent.

4) As each suspect exits the vehicle, he will be ordered to lie face-down on the

ground until he can be searched for weapons, and handcuffs utilized. As each
suspect is searched and handcuffed, he will be removed and placed in a police
vehicle until all suspects have been searched and handcuffed.  

5) The arresting officer will retain all evidence and maintain the chain of evidence

for court purposes.

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.

II.

POLICY
To pursue known and wanted criminals and traffic violators who fail to stop after being given
proper, sufficient notice.

PURPOSE
 Ensure the safest operation of pursuit vehicles during the vehicular pursuit.

III.

PROCEDURE

remaining in control of the vehicle at all times, and acting in full compliance with all
traffic laws and regulations.  

B.  Under emergency situations as defined herein, Section 46.2-920 of the Code of

Virginia authorizes vehicle operators to disregard certain traffic regulations specified
therein. However, neither the individual operator nor the Sheriff’s Office is immune
from Civil Liability for failure to use reasonable care. The Sheriff’s Office and the
individual operator may be liable for civil damages for the inflictions of personal or
property damage to the other drivers, other law enforcement personnel or bystanders
and their property if reasonable care is not exercised.

C.  The decision to initiate or to terminate a pursuit is based on the sound professional

judgment of the officer. Before reaching the decision to pursue, many factors must be
considered and carefully weighed. These factors include, but are not limited to:

a. Time of day
b. Day of week
c. Weather
d. Severity of offense
e. The chance of apprehending the suspect at a later time
f. Traffic conditions.

D. In initiating a pursuit, the Officer shall:

3) Location and direction of travel,
4) Reason for pursuit,
5) Estimated speed of pursuit,
6) Continual status/positional updates.

E. During pursuit, a safe distance must be maintained between vehicles.  Unmarked vehicles

should not be used in pursuit situations unless this is unavoidable. In the event an
unmarked patrol vehicle initiates the pursuit, this vehicle shall remain in the lead position
until a marked vehicle can take over the lead position. After the lead position has been
relinquished, the unmarked vehicle shall follow the pursuit.

F. The officer initiating the pursuit shall be responsible for filing all reports detailing the events

of the pursuit.

G. Officers shall not pursue violators against the flow of traffic on divided highways. In these
situations, parallel pursuit shall be allowed after considering the potential risks involved.

H. Secondary Unit’s Responsibilities:

1. When a secondary unit becomes involved in a pursuit, the secondary unit will

continually maintain radio contact with the communication center so that the primary
unit can concentrate on the pursuit.

2. No more than two Sheriff’s Office vehicles should be direct, close pursuit. Close

pursuits can be defined as being in visual contact with the offender and matching the
offenders speed. However, the supervisor shall have the authority to assign additional

I. Supervisory Responsibility

1. Supervisors must continually evaluate the justification for the pursuit. If the hazards

become too great or conditions in termination section have been achieved, the
supervisor shall terminate the pursuit.

2. The supervisor shall review all pursuits after completion and prepare a pursuit report

detailing the events.  This report shall contain the details of the event and any hazards
to the public and the officer that may have occurred. This report will be forwarded
through the chain of command and any violation of policy or procedures shall be
addressed immediately. This detailed report shall be completed by the end of the shift
and forwarded to the Major for review. It will be the Major's duty to inform the Sheriff
of the details and handling of the pursuit.  If this policy was to be found violated, the
officer may face disciplinary actions.

officers to the pursuit.  The following information should be relayed to the supervisor:

a.  The number of units engaged in the pursuits
b.  The location of the pursuit
c.  The reason for the pursuit

2. Communication shall be maintained with the pursuing agency.  If radio communication

is not possible, then the officers involved in the pursuit should direct the
Communications Center to maintain telephone contact with the agency involved in the
pursuit.

3.   If the pursuit continues outside the territorial limits of Tazewell County, the supervisor

shall terminate the pursuit.  However, if terminating the pursuit will place the other
agencies officer(s) in danger, the supervisor shall authorize the pursuit to continue
until additional units arrive to assist the pursuing officer(s).

L.  Termination of Pursuit

1.  A pursuit shall be discontinued when any of the following conditions exist:

a. Hazards of exposing the officer or the public to injury or serious property damage

is high, and the known offense is not serious enough to warrant the safety risk

2.  The officer deploying the spike strips should choose a location with barriers
such as roadway overpasses, guard rails, or other barriers to conceal and protect
the deploying officer. 

3.  Areas with high traffic, construction or special events/activities should be
avoided.

4.  Deployment positions should be done with consideration to the vulnerability of
public/ private property and other units assisting.

3. Deployment

1.  Pursuing units should coordinate with the officers deploying the tire deflation
devices in order to ensure the safe and effective use of the devices.
2.  The officer deploying the device shall be in position at a location in sufficient time

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY
Only the amount of force necessary will be used to control each circumstance.

PURPOSE
To ensure that officers have a clear understanding in regards to the use of force and its
limitations.

I.

II.

III.

DEFINITIONS
A.  Deadly force includes

1.  The firing of a firearm, even though no intent exists to kill or inflict bodily harm.
2.  Any force applied in any manner by any means that could reasonably be expected to

cause death or serious physical injury.

a. "Serious physical injury" means bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of

death or which is likely to cause serious permanent disfigurement or loss, or
extended impairment of the function of any body part or organ.

B.  Non-deadly force

Force employed which is neither likely nor intended to cause death or serious physical
injury.

C.  Non-Lethal Weapons

1.  Baton- ASP baton

2.  Oleoresin Capsicum Spray- OC or pepper spray

3.  Hollow Spike Strip/Stop Sticks- Stinger spike strips
a.  All sworn personnel will who carry any of these will receive refresher

training/qualification for these weapons at least biennially.

D.  Prohibited Non-Lethal Weapons-  Only department issued weapons are authorized.  The

carrying of any others are prohibited. (slapjacks, blackjacks, saps, etc.)

Page  206

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-07 Use of Force 
 

E.  Firearms- A firearm is considered to be any weapon from which a projectile is forcibly

ejected by an explosive force.

F.  Reasonable belief- When facts or circumstances the deputy knows, or should know, are
such as to cause an ordinary and prudent person to act or  think reasonably in a similar
way under similar circumstances.

G. Serious physical injury- A physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or which

causes death or serious and protracted disfigurement, or impairment of the function of
any bodily organ or limb.

H.  Excessive force- Force is excessive when its application is inappropriate to the

circumstances, resulting in serious physical injury or death to a

     suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Graham v. Conner, recently set forth guidelines for

determining whether force has been excessively applied: the   primary concern is
whether reasonableness in its application, as judged by the on-scene officer. Based on
the reasonableness standard, excessive   force may be determined based on:
1.  The severity of the crime.

2.  The nature and extent of the threat posed by the suspect.

3.  The degree to which the suspect resists arrest or detention.

4.  Any attempts by the suspect to evade arrest by flight or fight.

In evaluating the reasonable application of force, deputies must consider their own size,
strength, age, state of health and skill level with issued weapons as well the number of
deputies opposing the suspect(s).

IV.

PROCEDURES
Application of non-deadly force (Force Continuum) Virginia Criminal Justice Training
Academies and the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office trains personnel in the use-of-force
continuum, which emphasizes the response to increasing levels of threat. In most cases, the
use of force is considered non-deadly. All sworn personnel with the exception of
communications and office will receive training and demonstrate proficiency in the use of all
authorized weapons.  All sworn personnel will receive annual training on use of force. 

The Force Continuum is:

A.  Officer Presence
Mere presence of an officer is all that is needed to control a situation.

B.  Verbal control
Managing a situation through verbal communication.The volume and tone of voice, advice,
persuasion and orders are examples.  Body language also is in the category.  The Tazewell
County Sheriff's Office urges the use of verbal commands without the use of profanity,
disrespectful or argumentative statement.

C.  Soft Hand Contact and Attempted Restraint (Handcuffs)
A combination of strength, leverage, takedown's, control holds, or come-along's with

Page  207

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-07 Use of Force 
 

sufficient force to make the lawful arrest or gain control of someone, may be required when
lesser levels of force are ineffective. This shall include the use of hands, fists, feet, and
knees, elbows and so on in striking someone in order to gain control.

D.  Oleoresin Capsicum Spray
The use of OC spray is restricted to situations where higher levels of force are unnecessary
and lesser levels are ineffective or inappropriate.  .  

1.  OC spray shall not be used to threaten, to elicit information or persuade people to

comply with orders.

2. The application of OC should be kept to a minimum to effectively gain control.
3. Only officers that have received certification training may use OC spray. 

E.  Baton
The next level of force is the baton/impact weapon. The ASP baton should be used only to
the extent necessary to overcome resistance of the subject, and within the training standard.
 

G.  Hollow Spike Strip/Stop Sticks

1. The stinger spike strips shall be deployed by a sworn employee who has received
training in their use.  This training includes policy review, agency instruction in their
use, and practice deploying the spike strips using the manufacturer's
recommendations.

2. The spike strips will not be used to stop motorcycles, buses transporting passengers,

or vehicles transporting hazardous materials unless authorized by a supervisor and
continue travel by the suspect vehicle creates a hazard to the safety of the public and
officers.
Immediately after the vehicle passes over the spike strips, the device will be removed
from the roadway, and the deploying officer should be available to continue in the
pursuit.

4. Each Sheriff's Office vehicle assigned to sworn personnel shall be equipped with the
spike strips, to include the detective division and the spare vehicles used by the patrol
division.

3.

V.

LIMITATIONS ON FORCE
The following acts associated with the use of non-lethal force are prohibited.

A.  Application of choke hold or carotid control holds, except in the severe cases in which an
officer reasonably believes such maneuvers are the only means of protecting him/herself
or others from an imminent threat of serious injury or death.

B.  Use of Streamlites or Kel-lites or other flashlights as batons/impact weapons may only

be used if other department approved methods of control are impractical or not available.
The use of a flashlight under these circumstances shall be deemed an application of
deadly force.

C.   Any use of force not reasonably necessary in the light of the circumstances confronting

the deputy.

D.  Any forcible enforcement action when off duty except in situations which seriously

threatens life, valuable property, or public order.

OPERATIONS
5-07 Use of Force 
 

VI. DEADLY FORCE

A.  Firearms may be used:

1.

In defense of any person from what is reasonably believed to be an immediate threat
of death or serious bodily harm.

2. To apprehend a fleeing felon when all other means have been used to include an 

audible warning and probable cause exists that the escape of the person will present
an immediate and significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or
others. The officer must have knowledge that the felony was in fact committed by the
person fleeing arrest. In addition, the offense for which the apprehension is sought
must be an offense involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical
harm to warrant the use of deadly force. In evaluating a "significant threat," the officer
must reasonably believe that the person has either used deadly force in the
commission of a crime or may inflict death or serious harm to the officer or others if
apprehension is delayed.

3. To kill seriously wounded or dangerous animals when no other disposition is

reasonably practical. The on-duty supervisor shall be notified prior to discharge of the
weapon.

VII.  LIMITATIONS ON FORCE

The following acts associated with the use of force are prohibited.

A. Firing into crowds.

B. Firing "warning" shots.

C. Firing at or from a moving vehicle, except where the officer reasonably believes that:

1. An occupant of the other vehicle is using, or threatening to use, the vehicle as a form

of deadly force; OR

2. A vehicle is operated in a manner deliberately intended to strike an officer or a citizen

and all other means of defense have been exhausted to   include moving out of the
path of the vehicle, and the safety of innocent persons would not be unduly
jeopardized by the officers action.

D. Firing into a building or through doors when the person fired at is not clearly visible

unless officers are being fired upon from such building or doorway.

E. Firing at a suspect when lesser force could be used and the officer believes that the

suspect can be apprehended reasonably soon thereafter without the use of deadly force,
or when there is any substantial danger to others. 

     (When in doubt, DO NOT shoot!)

F.  Carrying or use of a second back-up firearm UNLESS the deputy has requested prior

approval from the Sheriff, and successfully qualified on an approved range with the
requested weapon.

G.  Use of deadly force against unarmed, non-dangerous fleeing felons, fleeing

misdemeanant's, or traffic offenders.

H.  Any use of force not reasonably necessary in the light of the circumstances confronting

Page  209

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual

the officer.

I.    Any forcible enforcement action when off duty except in circumstances which seriously

threatens life, valuable property, or public order.

INVESTIGATION OF THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE AND THE DISCHARGE OF

VIII.
FIREARMS

The procedures below shall apply to all situations in which an officer intentionally discharges
a firearm for the purpose of employing deadly force against a person. All instances of deadly
force which result in death or serious bodily injury will be investigated by the Virginia State
Police, however, in accordance with this policy, the Sheriff's Office will conduct a
simultaneous internal investigation.

A. The Sheriff, Major,and Chief of Operations shall be promptly notified of the use of deadly

force by either an on-duty officer or off-duty officer.  

B. The Sheriff or his designee shall designate a Detective who shall assume responsibility
for conducting a thorough investigation of the shooting. In cases where the shooting is
related to the commission of a crime for which the Detective Division has investigative
responsibility, the detective is limited to determining the propriety of the use of deadly
force. Proper coordination and cooperation are essential to ensure that neither aspect of
the total investigation is hampered.

C. Any officer whose use of deadly force results in the wounding or death of any person

shall be relieved from duty and placed on administrative leave by  the Sheriff or his
designee pending the outcome of the investigation.

IV.

THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS
The officer’s supervisor shall investigate the unintentional discharge of a firearm not
resulting in the death or injury of any person. In such cases the supervisor shall document
the findings in a memorandum, to be concluded before the end of the tour of duty in which
the investigation occurred and forwarded to the Sheriff.

X.

REPORTING USE OF FORCE

A.  Deputies shall document any application of force except for those arising in training or

office demonstrations.

B.  Immediately notify the supervisor in charge of any use of physical and/or deadly force.

C.  Submit a Use of Force report to the Major or his designee within 24 hours describing the

incident and any medical services rendered.

XI. OFFICE RESPONSE

A.  Review

1.  The Sheriff and Major shall review all reported uses of force to determine whether:

Page  210

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-07 Use of Force 
 

a.  Office policy was violated.
b.  Relevant Office policy was clearly understandable and effective to cover the
situation.
c.  Office training was adequate.

B.  Internal investigations

Internal investigations of serious applications of force (usually of compliance techniques
and more severe incidents) shall be of two types conducted simultaneously: First, an
administrative investigation to determine whether office standards were adhered to;
Second, a criminal investigation to determine if there was a violation of law. A criminal
investigation shall be discontinued whenever the Office is satisfied that no misconduct
occurred.  Dual internal investigations shall be conducted on all officer-involved
shootings. 

C.  Psychological services

Psychological follow-up of post-shooting trauma along with a psychological evaluation
shall be mandatory for all Sheriff’s Office employees. During an internal investigation, the
Office will do all within its power to avoid placement of a stigma on the officer who
discharges a firearm in performance of their duty. Following a shooting resulting in a
death, the officer shall not return to duty until a psychological evaluation has been
conducted, and the officer has received any necessary counseling.

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

POLICY
To define violator types, traffic violations, and uniform enforcement procedures.

PURPOSE

Procedures for stopping and approaching the traffic violator and to provide safety for all
in handling these violators.

PROCEDURE
A.  Stopping The Violator

1.

In Ideal Conditions:  When possible select an ideal place to make the stop. Select
areas that are well lit, have ample space, and provide visibility.   

I.

II.

III.

2. These procedures are to be followed when possible, and are presented from the

perspective that ideal conditions exists.

a. The deputy shall notify the communications center of the intended location of the

stop, the vehicle license number, description of the vehicle, and the number of
occupants in the vehicle.

b. Do not exit your patrol car until dispatch confirms your location, vehicle license

number, and any other information you gave to them.

c. The deputy should avoid stops on hills, curves, intersections, private drives, and

business locations that have limited parking.

d. The deputy should signal the violator to stop. This signal should be with

emergency lights, hand signals, sounding the horn, or the siren.  The spotlight
should be directed to the stopped vehicle inside rear view mirror, to obtain
maximum illumination.

e. The vehicle should be directed to the right side of the roadway close to the curb,

or onto the shoulder, if engineering design permits.

f. On multi-lane roadways, the deputy should insure the safety of the violator

during lane changes by gradually changing from lane to lane with the violator
until the right side of the roadway is reached.  

g. Should the vehicle stop abruptly in the wrong lane or in another undesirable

location, the driver should be promptly directed to move to a safer location. The
deputy should use the public address system, when so equipped, to give such
instructions.  

Page  212

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-08 Vehicle Stops/Traffic Enforcement  
 

B.  Approaching the Vehicle

4.

1. The deputy should position his vehicle approximately two car lengths behind the

stopped vehicle. The patrol vehicle should be positioned in such a manner as to form
a "protective pocket" for the deputy. This can be accomplished by positioning the
patrol vehicle parallel to the position of the stopped vehicle, approximately two feet to
the left, or positioned at a slight angle so that the left front of the patrol vehicle is
offset.

2. The deputy should exit the patrol vehicle and be continuously alert for any suspicious

movement or actions on the part of the driver or occupants of the stopped vehicle.

3. The deputy should approach from the rear of the stopped vehicle, touch the trunk lid

to ensure that it is closed, latched and to leave prints, look into the rear seat area, and
stop at a point to the rear of the trailing edge of the left front door. This position should
be maintained if there are only occupants in the front seat of the vehicle.
In cases where the stopped vehicle has occupants in both the front and rear seats,
the deputy should approach to a point near the leading edge of the left rear door. The
deputy should be especially alert for any unusual actions on the part of the occupants
and choose a path so that the door cannot be used as a weapon against the deputy.
From this position, the deputy can communicate with the driver and keep all
occupants in view.

5. The deputy should address the driver in a courteous manner and advise the reason
for making the stop. Items such as operator's license, registration cards, etc., should
be requested and not demanded. Do not ask the driver do you know why I
stopped you!!!

6. Should the deputy order the driver or occupants from the vehicle, no more than can

be  controlled should be allowed to exit. When ordering or requesting the driver or
occupants from the vehicle, the deputy should open the door to allow their hands to
remain in sight. The deputy should move back with the swing of the door and order or
request the driver/occupants to a position where conversation/questioning can safely
occur, whether in a neutral position or in the patrol vehicle. The deputy should
constantly be aware of suspicious movements when questioning, regardless of the
demeanor of those being questioned and pay attention to on coming traffic.

C.  When Special Conditions Exist:

1.

2.

In those stops made by two-man patrol vehicles, or where two deputies are present,
the passenger deputy or assisting deputy should be responsible for all radio
communications, writing all notes and messages relayed from the communications
center. During the stop he should act as an observer and cover for his fellow deputy.
At no time should the two deputies approach the driver together. If approach is
necessary, the passenger deputy or assisting deputy should approach the right side
of the stopped vehicle in the same manner as the primary deputy.
In hours of darkness, the deputy should insure that the patrol vehicle headlights are
on low beam.

3. The same precautions exercised in the initial approach should be re-employed upon

return the stopped vehicle.

4. The patrol vehicle radio and portable radio should be audible to the deputy during the

stop and should be readily accessible to send or receive transmissions.

5. When foot pursuit of the driver or occupants is deemed necessary, communications to

that effect should be transmitted for support. The patrol vehicle and weapons therein
should be secured before foot pursuit.

6. When approaching or questioning drivers and occupants, items such as flashlights,

Page  213

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-08 Vehicle Stops/Traffic Enforcement  
 

driver's licenses, etc., should be held in the hand opposite the deputy's weapon. The
deputy should attempt to have his weapon readily accessible personally, and
non-accessible to others. It is left to the deputy's discretion whether to have the driver
or occupants enter the patrol vehicle for the purpose of questioning, executing a
summons, etc. A frisk or pat-down is appropriate, when deemed necessary, for
persons entering the patrol vehicle. The same precautions exercised in the initial
approach should be re-employed upon return to the stopped vehicle to deliver a
summons, etc.

7. When approaching the suspect vehicle, the deputy, as a precautionary measure, shall

discretely place his right hand print on the left rear of the suspect vehicle while
walking up to the driver’s door. This handprint may be used as a means of
identification at a later date should the need arise. 

V.

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

A.  Different Types

1. WARNINGS:  A verbal warning may be issued to a violator whenever there is a minor

infraction committed in those areas where the offense is minimal. A properly given
warning can build rapport with drivers and can be just as effective as other types of
enforcement actions. 

2. VIRGINIA UNIFORM SUMMONS: A Virginia Uniform Summons should be issued for

a violator who jeopardizes the safe and efficient flow of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, including hazardous moving violations or unsafe and improperly equipped
vehicles. The deputy shall use the Virginia Uniform Summons for all traffic offenses. 

3. PHYSICAL ARREST:  In compliance with Code of Virginia 46.2-940, deputies shall

make a physical arrest: 

other intoxicants; 

a. Of violators of traffic laws pertaining to driving under the influence of alcohol or

b. When a felony has been committed involving a vehicle;
c. When the operator refuses to sign the “promise to appear” printed on the traffic

summons;

d. When the operator is licensed by a non-reciprocal state.

B.  Violations

Deputies should take appropriate action with the following violations for adults and
juveniles:
1. Driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs;
2. Driving suspended or revoked;
3. Speeding;

advised of his/her right to refuse, by reading the following from the DUI check
sheet, prior to the preliminary test.

Advice of Rights to a Preliminary Test:
If I suspect you of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic
beverage or (if under 21) after illegally consuming alcohol.  In accordance with law,
you are entitled to have your breath analyzed to determine the probable alcoholic
content of your blood, and upon request, to observe the process of analysis and the
reading on the equipment used to perform the test. You have the right to refuse to
permit your breath to be so analyzed, and failure to permit such analysis shall not be
used as evidence against you in a court of law. Should you elect to submit to such
breath analysis, the results shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution for
violation of Code of Virginia 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, or any similar ordinances.

B. GENERAL

1. Site Location

a. The Sergeant will prepare a list of inspection detail sites for the County.
b. All Inspection Detail Sites will be selected using the following criteria:
1) Site locations should be distributed throughout the county to ensure a

non-biased sampling of the motorists using the highways.

2) The site should have adequate visibility to provide safety to approaching

Page  221

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-09 Traffic Inspection Details - DUI Checkpoint
 

motorists and sworn employees conducting the detail.

3) The site should have adequate space available to park police vehicles off the

pavement and to allow vehicles to be pulled out of the traffic stream for
additional examination without creating a traffic hazard.

4) The site should be designated as approved for daylight or night operations, or

5) The site should have no particular characteristics, which would create a hazard

to motorists or sworn employees.

both.

2. Safety
Checkpoint locations will have been selected with safety as a prime objective. In addition,
the following procedures will apply:

a. Sufficient personnel will be available to relieve deputies who may be called upon

to perform additional questioning or to make arrests.

b. Sufficient personnel to serve as back-up deputies and to man pursuit vehicles

c. All deputies assigned to Traffic and/or DUI checkpoints will be fully uniformed

will be detailed to the checkpoint.

and wear a traffic safety vest.

d. Occasional traffic congestion may be handled by allowing all stopped vehicles to

pass through the checkpoint to prevent a traffic hazard, then resuming the
specified screening method.

e. The number of sworn employees assigned should be in proportion to the volume

of traffic

f. Patrol vehicles should be parked to provide protection to the sworn employees

and to be highly visible to approaching motorists.  They should be situated to
allow for pursuit if necessary.

g. Traffic control measures will be implemented to provide adequate warning to
motorists, i.e. use of flares, emergency lights, and using lighted areas at night
when other safety measures are inadequate. One sworn employee of the team
will be designated as the Traffic Control Officer responsible for directing traffic
into the checkpoint.

h. A safe place should be designated for those vehicles that require additional
inspection. This should be out of the general flow of traffic, preferably off the
roadway.

C.  CHECKPOINT OPERATION:

1.

If Traffic Inspection Details must be conducted at various times of the day and week
and at various locations.

2. Sworn employees will conduct traffic inspection details when assigned and approved

by a supervisor. Sites will be selected from the approved list and chosen prior to
beginning the detail.

3. The sworn employee setting up the inspection detail shall be responsible to see that

all precautions are taken to afford the highest degree of safety to motorists and sworn
employees

4. An alternate location should be used in the event safety considerations prevent

checkpoint operations at the intended location. Safety considerations may include
circumstances such as extremely heavy traffic due to some unforeseen event or a
major accident at or near the checkpoint location. Supervisors, in preparing the
operational plan to be used for such traffic inspection detail site shall specify the
screening method to be used at that particular location. Safety concerns such as sight
distance and traffic volume should be considered in determining the proper screening

Page  222

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-09 Traffic Inspection Details - DUI Checkpoint
 

method to be used at that particular location. Sworn employees conducting traffic
inspection details shall immediately change to the designated alternate screening
method, i.e. every third, fifth, or tenth vehicle as may be specified in the operational
plan, once a traffic back-up occurs beyond the specified number of vehicles or
measurable distance. Participating sworn employees should not deviate from the
operational plan. Vehicles will not be stopped on a discretionary basis. All vehicles,
regardless of type, shall be checked. This includes commercial vehicles, buses and
large trucks

D. DUI SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS

1. A DUI Sobriety Checkpoint is to identify and reduce the number of intoxicated drivers
on the highways, thereby reducing the number of alcohol or drug related automobile
accidents.

2. DUI Sobriety Checkpoint Site selection: Checkpoint site selections are to be based on

high DUI related accident experience and/or past DUI arrest activity. Accident and
arrest statistics coupled with sworn employee safety and motorist safety factors are
considered in selecting sites for sobriety checkpoints. Sobriety checkpoints are not to
be situated on highways where traffic speeds or other conditions would pose a threat
to motorists or sworn employees of the Checkpoint team. Additional considerations
include the presence of adequate lighting to illuminate the checkpoint and an area
adjacent to the checkpoint to allow for the parking of suspected DUI driver’s vehicles
and administration of field sobriety tests. The location must also allow for ample
warning to motorists approaching the checkpoint.

3. An Area Operational Plan shall be submitted for approval by supervisors. Area

Operational Plans shall address the following points:

a. The date, hours of operation, and location of each checkpoint.
b. Contingency plans for each checkpoint, which shall include:
1) An alternate location for use in the event safety considerations prevent

checkpoint operations at the intended location

2) Safety considerations may include circumstances such as exceptionally heavy

traffic due to some unforeseen event or a major accident at or near the
checkpoint location.

c. In preparing the operational plan to be used for each sobriety checkpoint site,

supervisors shall specify the screening method to be used at that particular
location. Safety concerns such as sight distance and traffic volume should be
considered in determining the proper screening method. The screening
procedure shall identify the number of vehicles or a specific distance measure
requiring a change to an alternate screening method. Once traffic congestion
occurs beyond the specified number of vehicles or measurable distance.
Occasional traffic congestion may be handled by allowing all stopped vehicles to
pass through the checkpoint to prevent a traffic hazard, then resuming the
specified screening method. Participating deputies should not deviate from the
operational plan. All vehicles, regardless of type, shall be checked. This includes
commercial vehicles, such as buses and large trucks.

d. A diagram will be provided of each checkpoint location depicting the roadway,

placement of traffic control devices, and secondary testing location for
administering the field sobriety tests.

e. Sobriety checkpoint teams should be composed of a sergeant or lieutenant and

sufficient personnel.

f. Sobriety checkpoint teams should normally operate for periods of four hours at

Page  223

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-09 Traffic Inspection Details - DUI Checkpoint
 

the same location.  However, the supervisor may discontinue operations at any
time for safety or operational reasons. Traffic volumes and general operating
conditions permitting, the supervisor may extend the operating period to a
maximum of six hours.

g. Adequate space should be available away from the checkpoint for the parking of

suspected DUI driver’s vehicles and the administration of field sobriety tests.
This space may be a coned traffic lane, a wide shoulder area, or other suitable
location. Provisions shall also be made for the vehicles of arrested parties in
keeping with departmental policy. Vehicles will not be stopped on a discretionary
basis, i.e. due to the “Looks” of the vehicle. However, this does not preclude
stopping a vehicle when the driver exhibits obvious signs of intoxication.

i.

h. Depending upon the configuration of the checkpoint, sufficient personnel should
be used as screening officers. When approaching a vehicle, screening deputies
shall scan the interior and occupants for weapons and/or other contraband. Upon
determining that no hazard exists, deputies shall advise the driver of the purpose
of the stop. Delays of motorists shall be kept to a minimum.
In the event the motorist shows signs or behavior normally associated with DUI,
further investigation will be conducted in the testing area to further investigate for
DUI. Arrestee's should be transported as expeditiously as possible. The deputy
who originally screens the driver shall conduct the field sobriety tests and arrest
the subject if appropriate. The arresting deputy should normally handle
transportation.  As a screening officer removes himself form a checkpoint
location with a suspected DUI, a standby officer shall rotate into position and
assume screening duties.  Drivers who are not arrested after completing the field
sobriety test shall be directed back into traffic.

j. The supervisor is responsible for the overall operation of the checkpoint. He is

also responsible for assuring that the above procedures are adhered to, and that
a record is kept of the number of vehicles that pass through the checkpoint,
number of arrests made, and any problems encountered.

k. Deputies not involved in traffic control or screening duties should position
themselves to observe traffic from a position of safety and be immediately
available to provide any further assistance. Duties should be rotated periodically
to prevent undue fatigue.

l. DURING ANY CHECKPOINT OPERATIONS, DEPUTIES WILL CONDUCT

THEMSELVES IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AT ALL TIMES.

E. TRAINING
All deputies are trained in DUI detection, screening, and apprehension methods.

liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY

Provide for the prompt and uniform recall of Deputies and civilian employees in
emergency situations. Those situations subject to recall of personnel shall be, but not
limited to the following: possible riot situations, active shooter(s), search of missing or
endangered persons, major disasters (commercial plane crash, weather emergencies,
etc.), or large gatherings where crowd control is mandatory.

II.   PURPOSE

Establish procedures for response to disasters and other unusual occurrences.

III.  DEFINITIONS

A.  Unusual Occurrence: Situations, generally of an emergency nature, that result from

disasters both natural and manmade and civil disturbances. In the category of disasters
are floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, and tornadoes. Civil disturbances
include riots, disorders, and violence arising from dissident gatherings and marches, rock
concerts, political conventions, and labor disputes.

B.  Emergency Mobilization: To marshal resources for action quickly, in response to a

disaster or unusual occurrence.

IV.  PROCEDURES

A.  Response Planning
The Sheriff or his designee will conduct planning and response to unusual occurrences.

B.  Incident Command
The senior supervisor at the scene of an incident is the Incident Commander until properly
relieved of that status by proper authority. 
The following policy’s outline special operations for specific unusual occurrences:

1.  Hostage/barricade situations;
2.  Bomb/Bomb Threats;

Page  236

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-14 Unusual Occurrences - Emergency Operations   
 

C.  Emergency Mobilization
Emergency mobilization is the gathering and putting into motion resources necessary for the
management and mitigation of disaster or potential disaster situations. Emergency
mobilization consists of the following:

1. Assembly Areas: The Sheriff, or his designee prior to the execution of the emergency
recall plan will designate assembly areas. The person executing the emergency recall
shall advise recalled personnel of the locations.

2. Equipment Distribution: The distribution of equipment for use in disaster incidents will

be accomplished at the direction of command personnel.  The locations, types and
amounts of equipment available for a multitude of disaster and unusual occurrence
situations are contained in the Emergency Operations Plan.

3. Key Personnel Designation: Key personnel for disaster and unusual occurrence

situations are specified in the Emergency Operations Plan. In addition, at the initiation
of the Alert Phase, depending on the situation, additional agency key personnel may
be designated.

4. Transportation Requirements: Transportation requirements above the use of sheriff's

vehicles will be determined at the earliest possible time.  

5. Management Control Measures: In disaster and unusual occurrence situations, the

Sheriff's Office utilizes a specific Chain of Command and management practices that
are nationally recognized. 

6. The Tazewell County Sheriff's Office has acquired the use of two military HUMVEE's. 

The acronym HUMVEE stands for High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle. 

a.  These vehicles offer the Sheriff's Office a vehicle capable of traversing very rough

terrain and over obstacles that a normal truck or SUV will not navigate.  The HUMVEE
has 16 inches of ground clearance, and is in 4 wheel drive mode at all times.  The
transmission is automatic, and the differential has a low range setting.  The differential
setting should be in "H" position at all times when operating the HUMVEE.  The
HUMVEE's should only be used when conditions require the use of the HUMVEE's
capabilities.  They Shall NOT be used for operations where normal agency issued
vehicles would be sufficient.  An appropriate use for the HUMVEE'S would be the
need for travel in an off-road area, such as the national forest roads or gas well roads,
into known areas where normal Sheriff's Office vehicle cannot travel, or in inclement
weather conditions that would prohibit normal vehicular travel.  In the event the
HUMVEE's are needed, a supervisor must approve the use of the the HUMVEE's. 
Personnel operating these special purpose vehicles should be aware that although
these vehicles posses a great ability to navigate in extreme off road conditions, safety
considerations still apply.  The HUMVEE, if operated unsafely, will still roll over, get
stuck, or crash.  If in doubt of the vehicles ability, or your own ability, do not drive the
HUMVEE there!  Further, the HUMVEE will not have any more ability on ice covered
roadways than any other four wheel drive vehicle.  Extreme caution should be applied
when driving on icy roadways.  The HUMVEE does NOT have anti-locking brake
systems.  All policy and procedures pertaining to routine and emergency operations
apply to the use and operation of the HUMVEE.The HUMVEE's are stored in the
secured lot at the county garage.  The key to the lot is on the keyboard in the
Deputy's Office.  . 

b.  There is an instructional video on the operation of the HUMVEE's located on the

server.  It is required that anyone who operates the HUMVEE's watch this
instructional video prior to using the vehicles.  Annual refresher training will be
conducted on the use and operation of the HUMVEE's for all Deputies, and annotated
on a signup sheet. 

c.  The fleet manager shall assign a supervisor to conduct a monthly line inspection on

Page  237

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-14 Unusual Occurrences - Emergency Operations   
 

the HUMVEE's.  This line inspection will include an equipment list, if the HUMVEE is
equipped with any equipment.  Any equipment required for the mission will be
transferred by the Deputy from his patrol vehicle to the HUMVEE.  Anytime the
HUMVEE's are to be used, the communications center will be notified by the
operating Deputy.  

7.  The Tazewell County Sheriff's Office possesses for its use ATV's and utility trailers to
transport the ATV's to areas where needed for use. 
a.  These vehicles offer the Sheriff's Office and its Deputies the ability to navigate in

terrain that other vehicles cannot.  These vehicles will only be used when conditions
require the use of these vehicles and their capabilities.  The ATV's will not be used for
operations where normal agency issued vehicles would be sufficient. 

Polaris Ranger  The Ranger is a 4 wheel ATV, but does not have 4 wheel drive
capability.  The Ranger will navigate most terrain.  The Ranger is of a 2 seat
configuration.  The Ranger has a gasoline engine.  Extreme caution should be used
when operating the ATV's.  These ATV's do not have canopies attached that would
eliminate the threat of the driver and passengers from being hit by tree limbs, brush or
other obstacles.  Also, these vehicle could be susceptible to rollovers if driven
improperly.  

Utility Trailer  The utility trailers will be used to transport the ATV's to the needed
locations.  The utility trailers may only be pulled by vehicles equipped with the
appropriate receiver and hitch and the appropriate 12-volt hook up for the trailer's
lights.  

b.  Deputies and supervisors must notify the communications center when these vehicles

will be in use.  Also, as these vehicle do not have on-board added equipment, any
equipment needed will need to be transferred from the Deputy's patrol vehicle to the
ATV. As with any agency issued vehicle, the fleet manager shall assign a supervisor
to conduct a monthly line inspection of these special purpose vehicle.  This line
inspection shall document the equipment readiness, and address any maintenance
needs to the fleet manager.  All personnel who operate the ATV's must be trained on
their use.  There is an instructional video on the operation of the ATV's and the utility
trailers on the TCSO server that must be viewed before operation.  Training will be
afforded to anyone who may potentially operate these vehicles.  There is a sign off
sheet once the instructional video has been viewed that must be signed by the deputy
and supervisor.  Annual refresher training will be conducted by the on duty shift
supervisor.    

D.  Enabling Legislation
Enabling legislation exists that permits responsive and preventative actions by law

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY 

To serve civil process in a timely manner and make proper returns in accordance with
state guidelines.

II.   PURPOSE

To provide the officers legal understanding for proper execution of civil papers.

SERVICE AND RETURN OF LEGAL PROCESSES

A.  General

1. The RETURN is to show the Court evidence of the officers means of service
2. The validity of the service is dependent upon the mode and return made. Civil process
can only be served on Sunday when a person is removing goods, fleeing their domain
and the courts allow the service. 
3. Three kinds of service to resident:

a. In person;
b. family member over the age of 16;
c. posting on the main entrance.

4. The return must show:

a. that the service was made at the defendant’s usual place of abode;
b. that the defendant was not found at the defendant’s usual place of abode;
c. the relationship of the person served to the defendant;
d. that the purpose of the paper was explained to the person served;
e. that the person served was over sixteen years of age; and
f. the date on which service was made.

5. The stamps used for proof of service provide for all legal requirements mentioned

above.  

6. A  record is created in the Civil Process Computer System that provides for:

a. Date received.
b. Agency tracking method.
c. Type of process; Civil/Criminal.
d. Nature of document.
e. Source of document.
f. Name and address of defendant, respondent, plaintiff, and complainant, as

Page  240

available.

g. Deputy assigned for service / served.
h. Date of assignment of deputy.
i. Method of service.
j. Name of person to whom process was served / attempted.
k. Date of service or attempted service / return if required.
l. Location of service / attempted service.
m.Reason for non-service.

B.  PROCESSES REQUIRING PERSONAL SERVICE  

1. Out-of-State Processes. These papers should be served in person to the individual

named unless it is a non-support (reciprocal) case originating out-of-state.

2.  Restraining Orders. An order, which is issued by a court forbidding the defendant to

do certain acts until a hearing on the application is heard. 

3.  Injunctions. A prohibitive writ issued by a court of equity forbidding a defendant in an

action to do some act, which the defendant is threatening or attempting to do and
which, if committed, would be unjust or injurious to the plaintiff and which cannot as
such be adequately redressed by an action at law.

4.  Garnishments and Attachments on Co-Defendants. The service to the co-defendant
should be served in person to an officer of the corporation or the individual who pays
the defendant or controls payment to the defendant. This is usually the payroll officer,
comptroller, or treasurer, but service to any officer or managing employee of the
business or corporation is valid. The co-defendant named  should always be served
regardless of information offered that the defendant is not employed by the
co-defendant or that no monies are due. It is up to the co-defendant to include such
information in the notarized statement as is required to make to the court by the trial
date. On garnishments there are certain wages and property that are exempt. These
exemptions are set forth in a schedule which is attached to the process being served
upon the co-defendant. An attachment, however, is applicable to all the wages, funds,
or personal property of the defendant that are under the control of the co-defendant at
the time of service. Always serve the co-defendant first.

NOTE:  After having served the co-defendant in a garnishment or attachment action and
a copy mailed to the judgment debtor, the defendant, if within the Sheriff’s jurisdiction,
can be served in person or by substituted service at the defendant’s usual place of
abode. 

5.  Corporations, Companies, Partnerships, and Registered Agents. A corporation cannot

be served with a process in any other way than by making an actual service on a
natural person who is an officer or agent of the corporation. Service on the spouse, as
such, of an agent or officer of the corporation is not valid unless the spouse is an
officer of the corporation. The persons upon whom service may be made in order to
serve a corporation or partnership are set forth below:

a. Municipal Corporations: Service may be made on the mayor, recorder, attorney,

manager, or any alderman, councilman, or trustee of the city or town.

b. Private Corporations: On the president or chief officer, vice-president, cashier,

treasurer, secretary, general superintendent, general agent, or registered agent.

c. Foreign Corporations: A foreign corporation is one which has been granted a

charter by a state other than Virginia. Service of process is made on the
registered agent of the corporation. In making the return, the registered agent’s
name should be followed by “Registered Agent for (name of corporation). ”The

Page  241

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

service should be made to the individual named as the registered agent, even if
the individual advises he/she is no longer the registered agent for the corporation
involved. If service cannot be made to a registered agent in a reasonable period
of time, alternate procedure of service through the Clerk of the State Corporation
Commission is valid.

d. Partnership: On any partner, provided that the suit is a partnership matter. In

Tazewell County it is permissible in the case of a law firm, for the service to be
made to the secretary of one of the partners as a personal service to such
partner provided the secretary has been granted such authority by the partner
involved. This authority will have to be in writing, signed by the partners,
indicating that they will consider such as personal service when delivered to the
secretary.

e. Unincorporated Associations, Orders, or Common Carriers: On any of its officers

or trustees. Service on an agent of an unincorporated association is not
sufficient. However, when the unincorporated association  is a common carrier,
service may be made to any agent of the carrier or a driver, captain, or
conductor of any vehicle of such carrier. If none of these can be found, service
may be made by publication.

6.  Protective Orders

a.  A Protective Order contains provisions requiring compliance on the part of the
allegedly abusing family member. Protective Orders are not warrants of arrest and
will not be treated as such.
b.  There are two types of Protective Orders:
1) Preliminary Protective Order 
2) Final Protective Order 
3) Immediately upon service all Protective Orders must be entered into VCIN.
c.  Both orders are effective with personal service of the order upon the allegedly
abusing spouse.  
d.  Service of Protective Orders
1) All protective orders will be personal service. 
2) The service of the orders will receive priority attention and should be made on

the same date the order is received if possible.

3) Deputies will provide the respondent with a copy of the order.
4) The original order will be returned to the Civil Office. 
5) When attempting to serve a protective order at a residence shared by the

petitioner and respondent, no fewer than two (2) deputies will attempt service.
e.  Protective Orders Which Grant Possession of the Residence to the Petitioner.
1) When deputies serve a protective order at the residence shared by the

petitioner and respondent and the order requires the respondent to grant the
petitioner possession of the residence (to the exclusion of the respondent), the
deputies shall escort the respondent off the resident property.

2) Deputies may, at their discretion and if there is no immediate threat of violence,

allow the respondent to gather personal belongings within a reasonable time.

C.  SUMMONS

1. General Summons. A summons brings a person under the jurisdiction of the court.
2. Jury Summons. Summonses to individuals for jury duty.
3.  Witness Summons. A summons for a witness.
4.  Juvenile and Domestic Relations Summons are as follows:

a.  The juvenile summons type, that summonses the juvenile involved and the
parents or guardians of the juvenile.

Page  242

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

b.  The non-support.
c.  The out-of-state or foreign process for non-support.
d.  Protective Order.
e.  The witness subpoena. 

5.  Interrogatory Summons
A summons to bring a defendant into court for the purpose of finding out from the
defendant, under oath, what property or estate he/she owns to satisfy a money judgment
6.  Garnishment Summons
The garnishment summons, a part of the fieri facias process, consists of the original
copy, accompanied by a Fi Fa form; a copy of the summons for the co-defendant to
which is attached a schedule of exempt wages; and a copy of the summons for service
on the defendant.
7.  Detinue Summons/Warrant
Detinue is an action, which seeks the recovery of personal property from one who has
acquired the property legally, but who retains it without right.  The action of detinue is
proper in every case where the owner prefers recovering the specific property rather than
sue for damages. It is an action taken by the plaintiff. The case has to be heard in court.
8.  Attachment Summons/Order
An attachment action is taken before the matter has come to court or is an attachment
before judgment. As compared to a garnishment action, an attachment served on a
co-defendant is effective only against property which the co-defendant is holding for or
owes the defendant at the time service is made. The attachment order can be effective
against either personal property or real estate. An attachment order can be used as an
attachment (as a levy) and as seizure of personal property. When personal property is
seized under an attachment order, its possession is normally taken over by the Sheriff
and held pending its disposition as ordered by the court.

Its application must be carefully executed and carried out only as prescribed.
Is a foreign corporation, or is not a resident of this state, and has estate or
debts owing to said defendant within Tazewell County, or that said
defendant, is entitled to the benefit.
Is removing, or is about to remove property. 
Intends to remove, or is removing, or has removed the specific property.
Is converting property.
Has assigned or disposed of the estate.
Has absconded, or is about to abscond.
The attachment order has three main actions:

a.  A command that specific property be attached;
b.  Upon execution of a bond, possession be taken of personal property; and
c.  The defendant and co-defendant be summoned.
NOTE:  It is policy of the Sheriff's Office to require a bond. 

9.  Subpoena Duces Tecum
Documentary evidence is needed as well as the testimony of an individual witness. A
subpoena is issued to summons the person holding the documents, records, or books
into court to present the documents for court examination and to testify. This is called a
“Subpoena Duces Tecum.”  It is served in accordance with the rules, since it is usually
served at a place of business, it is served there either to the individual named or his/her
supervisor.
10.  Summons for Unlawful Detainer can be personal, family member or posted.

D.  CIRCUIT COURT ACTIONS

Page  243

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

1.  The two most commonly used processes for circuit court actions are:

a.  Notice of Motion for Judgment; and
b.  Subpoena in Chancery.

Affixed to each action, as a separate piece of paper, will be a “Proof of Service” form on
which the return is made by the deputy sheriff making the service. The “Notice of Motion for
Judgment” will have attached to it a statement or affidavit which sets forth the specifics of
the motion for judgment by the plaintiff, and the “Subpoena in Chancery” will have attached
to it a “Bill of Complaint” which contains the details of the complaint (usually an action
involving a pendente lite, divorce, or separation) being made by the complainant.  A
“Subpoena in Chancery” is in the nature of a summons to a defendant rather than a witness
summons.  It requires the person named to appear before the court to answer the complaint
of the petitioner or to show cause why he/she should not be required to give the relief
demanded.

2.  Petitions
A petition is an application in writing to the court stating the circumstances upon which it
is founded and requesting an order of the court or such other relief as is desired by the
petitioner.  

3.  Mechanics Lien
This is a lien of a contractor, subcontractor, laborer, or material man who has performed
labor or furnished material of the value of $50.00 or more.  A mechanics lien can also
apply to repairs.

A mechanics lien has to be recorded before the expiration of sixty (60) days from the time
the structure is completed or the work thereon terminated; suit to enforce this lien must
be brought before the expiration of six (6) months. Petitions may be made to the
appropriate court for sale of the property.  A court order is issued authorizing the Sheriff
to sell the property. Before making the sale, petitioner shall advertise the time, place, and
terms thereof and give owner notice by service as prescribed under Virginia code or, if
the owner is a non-resident or if owner’s address is unknown, it may be served by posting
a copy of the sale notice in three public places in the city wherein the property is located.
If such property is a motor vehicle registered in Virginia, the Commissioner of the Division
of Motor Vehicles should be requested to advise if there are any liens thereon; if so, the
lien holder must be notified by certified mail at the address given in the title certificate of
the time and place of the properly sale ten (10) days prior thereto.

E.  RENT ACTIONS

1. Eviction Notices

a. Five-Day Notice – if the tenant is in arrears in rent
b. Thirty-Day Notice – if tenant rents on a monthly basis and the landlord desires to

evict the tenant for reasons other than delinquency

c. Summons for Unlawful Detainer – summons the defendant to appear in court
d. Writ of Possession - the original writ is retained by the deputy sheriff as authority

for the action and upon which to make a return when the eviction is completed.
The writ is served to the defendant in person, or by substituted service or by
posting. This notice is made out by the Civil Process Division to show the name
and address of the defendant, and the date and time the premises must be
vacated (minimum of seventy-two (72) hours as required by law).

The deputy sheriff’s action on the Writ of Possession is as follows:

Page  244

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

Fill out the Writ of Possession to the tenant after coordinating with owner or manager of
premises. Make sure owner/manager understands it is their responsibility--not that of the
Sheriff--to move the defendant’s furniture and personal property out of and off the
premises (if the defendant has not done so voluntarily by the time set for eviction). The
furniture and personal property of the defendant have to be moved to the nearest public
right-of-way. If the defendants move out before being physically evicted, the eviction
action is considered completed and the writ of possession noted accordingly. In the event
of inclement weather at the scheduled time for the eviction, it is the practice of the Sheriff’
s Office to postpone the eviction until, such time as the eviction can be carried out. ( see
attached Code 55.237.1 for lockout procedures. )

2.  Mobile Home 
Upon receipt of a court-ordered Writ of Possession involving a mobile home, the deputy
shall:

a.  Give Notice:
1) Notify the lienholder (if known) of the impending eviction status.
2) Notify the landlord/lot owner of available options:

a)  The mobile home can be stored on the existing lot for ninety (90) days; or
b)  The mobile home can be moved to an unimproved lot of the same mobile

home park at the owner’s expense. 

b.  Eviction Execution:
1) If the mobile home has been removed or is in the process of being removed by
the owner, the deputy may extend the allotted time necessary to complete the
removal and then give possession of the lot to the lot owner. The executed Writ
of Possession is then returned to court.

2) If the mobile home has not been removed by its owner at the end of

seventy-two hours the deputy shall evict any occupant(s) and possession of the
lot is then given to the landlord/lot owner, who then chooses option (a) or (b) for
the ninety-day storage of the mobile home. The executed Writ of Possession is
returned to court.

F.  LEVIES, SEIZURES, AND SALES
Two basic kinds of levies/seizures:

1. A distress warrant is an attachment of the property before judgment is rendered. A

seizure of the property, however, made under a distress levy is effected only after the
prescribed time of appeal of the distress levy has elapsed.

2. An execution carries out a judgment or decree. The two main types of executions are:

(1) a writ of fieri facias (fi-fa), which is the means to enforce a money judgment by
levy and sale of the property of the defendant; and (2) the writ of possession, which
enables the plaintiff to obtain possession of specific property. The defendant has the
option of retaining the specific property or paying the amount of the judgment.  The
type of levy, seizure, and sale covered in the balance of this section will be restricted
to executions carried out under a fi-fa. In considering the relationship between a fi-fa
and a levy carried out under a fi-fa, the following points are relevant:

3. A lien on the personal estate of the judgment debtor is established dating from the
exact time that the writ of fi-fa is received in the Sheriff’s Office for execution and is
endorsed with year, month, day, and time of day the writ is received. This procedure
is followed so that the Sheriff’s Office can control the priority on levies when more
than one is received for execution against the same individual.

4. This lien covers leviable property as well as non-leviable property, such as bonds,

Page  245

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

5.

notes, stocks, etc., which the judgment debtor has or may acquire  “on or before the
return date of such writ,” except such property as is exempt under provisions of Title
34. The lien extends only to non-leviable property located within the Commonwealth
and leviable property within the Sheriff’s bailiwick.
In Virginia the fi-fa is returnable ninety (90) days after its issuance in district court, and
on term day in Circuit Court (sixty days). A lien on tangible property automatically
ceases if an actual levy has not been made on or before the return date.

6. The lien acquired by placing a writ of fi-fa in the hands of the Sheriff is so imperfect in

nature and unspecific as to the goods of the debtor that an actual levy is always
advisable for establishment of a solid lien and security for the debt. The levy, in effect,
specifies the goods and chattels levied upon and is necessary as a basis for
advertising the property and selling it (within six (6) months after execution).
 A levy can be made only upon specific tangible property. Actual seizure of the
property recovered is not necessary if the deputy has the property in his/her view and
power to seize it if he/she so chooses, and notes on his/her writ the facts of the levy.

7.

Specific points to keep in mind in effecting a levy under a fi-fa are as follows:

a.  After receipt and endorsement of the fi-fa in the Sheriff’s Office, the actual levy is

the next step necessary before a sale can be made.

b.  Although the fi-fa authorizes seizure of property, the practice in Virginia has been

on the premises of the debtor until the day of sale in order to save expenses.

c.  A valid levy can be made on household goods in the owner’s absence; no formal

notice is necessary. However, a copy of the levy should be left on the items levied
upon.

d.  In making a levy, the Sheriff is acting as agent for the plaintiff. The plaintiff or

his/her attorney has authority to control the execution and to say whether the levy
should be modified or canceled. (The plaintiff retains the right to sue out a new
execution.)

e.  A deputy making the levy may, if need be, break open (or cause to be opened by a

locksmith) the outer doors of a dwelling house in the daytime after first having
demanded admittance of the occupant and may also levy on property in the
personal possession of the debtor if the same be open to observation. The deputy
should first check to insure that the defendant does live at the address. The deputy
should then check with neighbors, mailman, paperboy, etc., to determine whether
defendant is: (1) on vacation; (2) in the hospital; (3) in jail. Only as a last resort
should entry be forced to complete a levy, and then only after the deputy’s
supervisor has been notified and briefed.

f.  Levy on any personal property in the possession of the defendant, regardless of
his/her claim that it does not belong to him/her, etc. The claimant (or third party
involved) has a right to claim ownership by filing the necessary affidavit with the
Clerk of court (8-266, 8-227).

g.  When listing property, IDENTIFY it--use make, model, serial number, etc. If none

of these are available, some definite description should be used so that, if
necessary, it can be identified at a later date.

h.  Levy on property that would be equal in value to the amount claimed in the warrant.

Place a fair market value on items and bear in mind not to over-levy (unless
circumstances alter the above, such as property that has been abandoned, and it
is necessary to attach all property in order to dispose of it).

i.  If the plaintiff requests seizure of the property prior to sale (sometimes desirable as
in the case of mobile vehicles), a bond is provided the Sheriff by the plaintiff for an
amount equal to the value of the vehicle.  Identification, including license number

Page  246

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

and registration information, is also furnished by the plaintiff. The vehicle or
property is moved at the plaintiff’s expense to an area of safe storage pending the
sale.

j.  When the execution is in favor of the Commonwealth, a levy can be made on realty,

but normally a levy is made only on personality. It is still necessary, however, to
attempt to satisfy the debt out of the personal property before selling the realty.

k. Property and articles exempt from a levy made under a fi-fa are set forth in Virginia
Code 34-26 and 34-27. The articles most commonly found and which are exempt
include the following: necessary wearing apparel of the debtor and his/her family;
sufficient bed, bedding, tables and chairs needed for the size of the family; plus a
refrigerator, washing machine, cooking utensils, one sewing machine and, in the
case of a mechanic, tools of his/her trade. A detailed list, as set forth in 34-26- and
34-27, is provided each deputy making levies. In addition, each householder has a
basic exemption of property, either realty or personality, not exceeding five
thousand dollars as provided in 34-4. This householder’s exemption is usually
waived at the time the debtor signs or executes a promissory note or other
obligation of indebtedness.

l.  A levy cannot be made on intangible personal property, but a lien attaches to it by

court order within a year after the return date of the execution.  The lien in this
case continues as long as judgment can be enforced and it does not matter
whether the return date of the writ has passed or not.

m. Personal property belonging to a spouse may not be levied upon under an

execution for the debt of his or her spouse.

n.  At the time the levy is made the deputy making the levy estimates the value of the
property levied upon and makes a notation on the levy sheet on the amount of the
indemnifying bond required. The amount of the bond is set at the estimated value
of the property in the case of a fi-fa (or a warrant of distress). In Tazewell County
this bond is usually not required unless the property is to be seized and sold.
o.  One exception to be noted to the general rule that a levy can only be made on
specific tangible property is that a levy on shares of stock is valid provided the
shares are actually seized by the deputy executing the writ and are surrendered to
the corporation, or their transfer by the debtor is enjoined (13.1-413).

p.  Real estate cannot be levied upon and sold under an execution; however, if the
judgment on which the execution issues is a lien on real estate, the lien can be
enforced after all personal property of the debtor has been exhausted. This lien is
enforced as a fill of equity. The chancery court can order the amount of the
judgment unless such rents and profits will not satisfy the judgment within five (5)
years, in which case the court may direct the property sold (8-764).

q.  A levy cannot be made on the contents of a locked safe deposit box since the
contents are not within view or power of a seizure (unless the renter opens it
voluntarily); however, in any case where a bank or trust company having for rent
safe deposit boxes, is served with a notice of a lien of fi-fa or a summons in
garnishment in which a renter or lessee of a safe deposit box is named defendant
or judgment debtor, it shall be the duty of such bank or trust company to deny such
renter or lessee access to the safe deposit box rented or leased in the name of the
defendant or judgment debtor, unless otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by the judgment creditor (6.1-333).

8.  Sales
The sale is the final action taken under a writ of fi-fa. The following considerations apply
to such actions.

Page  247

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-15 Civil Process 
 

a.  Only property subject to levy and which has been levied upon can be sold.
b.  It is required that notices of the time and place of the sale be posted at least ten

(10) days prior to the day of the sale.

c.  The notice of sale is posted at some place near the residence of the owner, if

he/she resides in the city, and at two other public places in the city.

d.  If the property is expensive to keep or perishable, the court or authority issuing the

fi-fa  can order that the sale be made without waiting for the ten day period to
elapse.

e.  At the time and place so established, the property shall be sold to the highest
bidder, for cash, as may be necessary to make the amount of the fi-fa. When
property remains unsold because of no bidders or because of an insufficient bid,
the sale may be postponed and the property again advertised, stating the fact of no
bidders or of insufficient bid, and that the property will be sold peremptory under a
writ of venditioni exponas (8-418).

f.  No Sheriff or any employee shall directly or indirectly purchase effects sold under a

writ by such officer.

g.  No such officer or deputy shall act as auctioneer, except when selling under a writ,

unless he/she first obtains a license to conduct the business of an auctioneer or
common crier (8-428).

h.  The deputy must collect for each item sold even if the plaintiff buys it and wants to

pay only costs.

i.   As each item is sold, list the buyer, amount and item number on the copy of sale
notice.  If the number of items for sale is extensive, it is advisable for the deputy
making the sale to have clerical assistance in marking the items for identification,
keeping track of the buyers and selling prices, collecting the cash and giving
receipts for same to the buyers.

j.   The day before the sale it is wise to check with the plaintiff to make sure there has

been no settlement and that the plaintiff or his/her attorney will be present at the
sale.

k.  It is the policy of the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office that prior to the sale, the

attorney takes the following actions:
1) Obtain a Sheriff’s Indemnifying Bond (unless sale is ordered by the court).
2) Provide the Sheriff’s Office with a written statement advising whether or not liens

exist on items to be sold, a letter or teletype from the Department of Motor
Vehicles regarding any liens on vehicles. The plaintiff also submits an itemized
list of court costs, bond premium, and total amount required to settle the claim.

l.   When there is not time on the date appointed for the sale to complete same, the

sale may be adjourned from day to day until completed.

m. Each sale is made on an “as is” basis with no warranties implied as to the quality or
soundness of the goods sold. If an item has a lien on it, however, it is sold subject
to the lien as advised by the auctioneer (based on information supplied by plaintiff).
If the sale price is not in excess of the lien (plus costs), no sale should be made.

n.   In each sale scheduled, a sale folder is prepared in which background papers are
kept. A sale check list is maintained in this folder to insure that the required steps
are taken prior to the sale. In addition, copies of the levy and the sale notice are
filed in the folder. The procedure as described above is set forth. At the actual
sale, the sale is started by reading the sale notice which, subsequent to the levy,
will have been adjusted or noted, if necessary, to reflect liens or other information
supplied by the plaintiff.

o.  If property which has been levied upon is also to be seized preceding the sale

thereof, the owner may retain possession of such property until the date of sale

provided he/she gives the Sheriff a bond with sufficient surety payable to the
creditor which states the property shall be forthcoming at the day and place of sale.
The bond would specifically state the amount due, including the officer’s fee for
taking the bond, commissions, and other lawful charges, if any, and that service of
the writ has been made. The law relating to forthcoming bonds was passed for the
benefit of the owner of the goods taken, to enable him/her at his/her own risk to
retain possession and use of the goods and to avoid the expense of their
safekeeping until the day of sale (8-450).

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY

To serve legal processes of a criminal nature and affect arrests as necessary, both with
or without warrants, in accordance with the Code of Virginia. Only sworn deputies of the
Sheriff's Office in accordance with the law shall perform all such arrests and services.

II.   PURPOSE

To unify arrest procedures.

III.  DEFINITIONS

A.  Arrest
When a person is taken into custody in order that he/she may answer for an offense or
when there is a deprivation or restraint of another's liberty in any significant way.

B.  Probable cause   
Where facts and circumstances are such as to cause a person of reasonable caution to
believe that an offense is being or has been committed, and that the person to be arrested
has committed the offense.

IV.  PROCEDURE

A.  CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES: Criminal offenses for which an individual can be

arrested are divided into felony and misdemeanor categories, as follows:
1.  A felony arrest can be affected:

a. The offense is observed by the arresting deputy.
b.  Probable cause exists.
c. With a valid arrest warrant.
d. Upon knowledge of the existence of a warrant.

2. A misdemeanor arrest may be affected:

a. If the offense is observed by the arresting deputy.
b. With a valid arrest warrant.
c. Under the provisions of Section § l9.281 of the Code of Virginia.

Subsection  §19.281.  Arrest without warrant authorized in certain cases. – Members of

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-16 Arrest Procedures 
 

the State Police force of the Commonwealth, the sheriffs of the various counties and
cities, and their deputies, the members of any county police force, regular game wardens
appointed pursuant to §29.1-200, the members of any duly constituted police force of any
city or town of the Commonwealth and the special policemen of the counties as provided
by Subsection §15.21737, provided such officers are in uniform, or displaying a badge of
office, may arrest, without a warrant, any person who commits any crime in the presence
of such officer and any person whom he has reasonable grounds or probable cause to
suspect of having committed a felony not in his presence.  Any such officer may arrest
without a warrant any person whom the officer has probable cause to suspect of
operating a watercraft or motor boat (i) while intoxicated in violation of subsection B of
§29.1-738 or (ii) in violation of an order issued pursuant to §29.1-738.4, in his presence,
and may thereafter transfer custody of the person suspected of the violation to another
office, who may obtain a warrant based upon statements made to him by the arresting
officer.  Any such officer may, at the scene of any accident involving a motor vehicle,
watercraft as defined in §29.1-712 or motorboat, or at any hospital or medical facility to
which any person involved in such accident has been transported, or in the apprehension
of any person charged with the theft of any motor vehicle on any of the highways of
waters of the Commonwealth, upon reasonable grounds to believe, based upon personal
investigation, including information obtained from eyewitnesses, that a crime has been
committed by any person then and there present, apprehend such person without a
warrant of arrest.   Such officers may arrest, without a warrant, persons duly charged with
a crime in another jurisdiction upon receipt of a photocopy of a warrant, telegram,
computer printout, facsimile printout, a radio, telephone or teletype message, in which
photocopy of a warrant, telegram, computer printout, facsimile printout, radio, telephone
or teletype message shall be given the name or a reasonably accurate description of
such person wanted, the crime alleged.  Additionally, any such officer may arrest, without
a warrant, for an alleged misdemeanor not committed in his presence when the officer
receives a radio message from his department or other law-enforcement agency within
the Commonwealth that a warrant for such offense is on file. Such officers may also
arrest, without a warrant, for an alleged misdemeanor not committed in their presence
involving (i) shoplifting in violation of Subsections §18.296 or §18.2103 or a similar local
ordinance, (ii) carrying a weapon on school property in violation of §18.2-308.1, (iii)
assault and battery, (iv) under the circumstances of VA Code Section 52-20; if you think
the subject is likely to flee the Commonwealth in a gas drive off situation (v) brandishing
a firearm in violation of §18.2-282, or (vi) destruction of property in violation of §18.2-137,
when such property is located on premises used for business or commercial purposes, or
a similar local ordinance, when any such arrest is based on probable cause upon
reasonable complaint of the person who observed the alleged offense.  The arresting
officer may issue a summons to any person arrested under this section for a
misdemeanor violation involving shoplifting.

§19.2-81.3 allows for the arrest without a warrant in cases of assault and battery against
a family or household member and stalking and for violations of protective orders.

B.   Warrants

1.  Warrant Service

a. Whenever possible, arrests will be made after issuance of a warrant. Unless such
action is likely to cause the defendant to flee or otherwise avoid arrest, it shall be
the policy of the Agency that the assigned deputy shall request, by telephone,
defendants named in arrest warrants to report to the appropriate police facility for
service of the warrant. Whenever feasible, this approach is preferred over effecting

Page  251

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-16 Arrest Procedures 
 

the physical arrest of the defendant at his residence or place of employment.  

b.  Sworn personnel executing arrest warrants shall not search a third party residence

for a suspect unless there is probable cause to believe the suspect is present on
the premises. In addition, one of the following situations must exist:
1) A deputy is in hot pursuit of a suspect.
2) Consent of the owner or person occupying the premises to be searched.
3) There exists a justifiable fear of injury to people or property if the arrest is

4) Other exigent circumstances are present; i.e., those circumstances requiring

delayed.

immediate action.

If one of the aforementioned situations does not exist, a search warrant shall be
obtained.

These criteria do not apply to a property owned or leased by the person named in the
warrant. Probable cause to believe the person named in the warrant is present on his
own premises is sufficient reason to conduct the search.

2.  Warrant Control Procedures:

a.  Office of the Sheriff Responsibility:
1)  All warrants, summons, capias, detention orders, etc., of a criminal nature,

shall be routed through the Office of the Sheriff for proper recording and
issuance, prior to service. This includes criminal processes originating in
Tazewell County and those received from outside jurisdictions. Only under the
most urgent of circumstances, and with the consent of the ranking onduty
supervisor, will warrants be served without first being routed through the Office
of the Sheriff. In these instances the serving deputy and ranking supervisor is
responsible to ensure that a copy of the executed warrant is forwarded to the
Office of the Sheriff so that it may be entered in the computer as a permanent
record of it’s issuance and of the subsequent arrest.

2) Upon receipt of a criminal process, the Office of the Sheriff shall ensure the

following steps are taken:
a) Assign the document a Warrant Control Number.
b) Enter the warrant, capias, etc, in the wants/warrants file of the Sheriff’s

Office Warrant computer system, including the following information:

Date/time received
Type of legal process (warrant, capias, summons, etc.)
Charge/nature of document
Name and full info. on person named in document
Under "remarks", any pertinent info. on subject
Originating/issuing jurisdiction (court)
Deputy assigned for service
Date assigned
Date service due
c) Enter the individual named in the document in the wanted files of NCIC and

VCIN, if appropriate.

d) The warrant is then placed in the assigned deputies box.

3) Warrants and other criminal processes originating/issued in Tazewell County,

which are to be forwarded to a foreign (outside) jurisdiction for service, including
police agencies of incorporated towns within the County, will be handled in the
same manner as above, with the following exceptions:

Page  252

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-16 Arrest Procedures 
 

a) A form letter requesting service will be executed and attached.
b) Said warrant, capias, etc., will be forwarded to the appropriate jurisdiction for

service.

c) Entries in the Sheriff’s Office computer wants/warrants file will be the same,

except where the deputy assigned is normally listed, the agency name to
whom the document is forwarded will appear.

4) Upon return of the tracking sheet and/or form letter requesting service,

indicating service was made, the Office of the Sheriff will make the following
computer entries:
a) Date/time of service
b) Location of service
c) Executing Deputy/Officer
d) Method of service (arrest, summons, etc.)

The Tracking Sheet and/or the form letter requesting service will be retained on file
as proof of service for two (2) years. The Office of the Sheriff shall forward a copy
of all executed warrants to dispatch so a query of the NCIC/VCIN wanted person
files can be done to ensure that the subject has been removed after service.

5) Upon return of a criminal process indicating nonservice, the Office of the Sheriff

shall make an entry in the wants/warrants computer file indicating the deputy
assigned as "file". Said document, along with the tracking sheet will be placed in
the active warrant file pending service.

6) Wants/Warrant inquiries may be made by deputies on a twenty-four hour a day
basis. These inquires can be made by contacting the communications center via
telephone or radio.

7) The Office of the Sheriff shall constantly review the status of onfile warrants,
capias, summons, etc. Quarterly status reports shall be prepared and sent to
the Sheriff for review and forwarded to the Commonwealth's Attorney for
disposition determination in accordance with Section §19.276.1 of the Code of
Virginia.

      

b.  Deputy Responsibility:
1) Immediately upon receipt of a warrant/legal process, the assigned deputy shall
review the document for accuracy, completeness, and applying the appropriate
incident number. It is the responsibility of the deputy attempting service to
ensure that the warrant, capias, etc., is valid and properly executed, in
accordance with Section §19.272 of the Code of Virginia.  (See below)

Subsection §19.272.  When it may issue; what to recite and require. On complaint of a
criminal offense to any officer authorized to issue criminal warrants he shall examine
on oath the complainant and any other witnesses, or when such officer shall suspect
that an offense punishable otherwise than by a fine has been committed he may,
without formal complaint, issue a summons for witnesses and shall examine such
witnesses. If upon such examination such officer finds that there is probable cause to
believe the accused has committed an offense, such officer shall issue a warrant for
his arrest.  The warrant shall (i) be directed to an appropriate officer or officers, (ii)
name the accused or, if his name is unknown, set forth a description by which he can
be identified with reasonable certainty, (iii) describe the offense charged with
reasonable certainty, (iv) command that the accused be arrested and brought before a
court of appropriate jurisdiction in the county, city or town in which the offense was
allegedly committed, and (v) be signed by the issuing officer.  The warrant shall

Page  253

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-16 Arrest Procedures 
 

require the officer to whom it is directed to summon such witnesses as shall be therein
named to appear and give evidence on the examination.  But in a city or town having a
police force, the warrant shall be directed "To any policeman, sheriff or his deputy
sheriff of such city (or town)," and shall be executed by the policeman, sheriff or his
deputy sheriff into whose hands it shall come or be delivered. (Code 1950, Subsection
§19.191; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c.495; 1991, c.420.)

2) The deputy assigned the warrant, capias, etc.,shall proceed as soon as possible

to serve the document, as demands for service allow.

3) If the subject named in the legal process is found, the deputy shall execute the

document and either arrest the person, or release on a summons, as
appropriate and in accordance with law. The executing deputy shall send a copy
of the executed document to the Communications Center for processing. The
Communications Center will complete the tracking sheet. The Communications
Center is responsible for documenting the warrant as served in the Sheriff’s
Office computer system and returning the original to the proper court.

4) In the event that service is attempted and not made before the end of the shift,
the assigned deputy shall return the document to the Sheriff’s Office.  Under no
circumstances shall a deputy retain a legal process past his tour of duty.

5) Felony arrests and misdemeanor arrests reportable to the CCRE in which the

person arrested is not released on a summons:
a) Each arrest will be documented on an IBR report.
b) The criminal history will be run at the jail before they are taken before a

magistrate.

c) The fingerprinting is done at the jail.
d) The photograph is taken at the jail.
e) The IBR is then updated in the Sheriff Pak system.

C.  Use of Force  Injuries in Arrest Situations
Malicious assaults committed by deputies constitute criminal misconduct. Only that amount
of force necessary to affect a lawful arrest and/or overcome resistance to such arrest shall
be used. The use of force by a deputy with or without a weapon, or any force which causes
physical injury to any person, shall be reported as follows:

1. The use of any force or accidental injury to a prisoner or other person involved in an

arrest situation which results in injury requiring medical treatment by rescue or
hospital personnel or an injury for which medical treatment is refused shall be
reported via the Use of Force Form (which is typed not hand written) by the deputy to
the Patrol Division Supervisor within twenty-four hours of the incident. The deputy
must complete an incident report and the supervisor in charge made aware of the
situation. The immediate supervisor shall conduct an investigation and report the
findings in writing to the Major prior to the conclusion of the tour of duty.  

2.  Whenever a nonlethal weapon is used to make an arrest or overcome resistance to

arrest and without injury resulting, the deputy who used force shall inform his
immediate supervisor of the incident. A complete description of the use of force shall
be included in the deputy's offense report and a Use of Force Form shall be
completed. The report shall be forwarded to the shift supervisor for review and then
forwarded to the Major at the conclusion of the tour of duty.

In either instance a deputy of higher rank shall conduct the investigation. If a person of
higher rank is not on duty then one will be called out to conduct the investigation.

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-16 Arrest Procedures 
 

D.  Domestic Violence
1. Whenever a deputy is investigating a domestic assault, an arrest shall be made, provided:

a. There are visible signs that an assault has occurred;
b. There is probable cause to believe the suspect has committed the crime.

In all domestic cases, information shall be given to the victim concerning the services
offered through various county liaisons, i.e. Victim/Witness Program, Mental Health, or
Social Services for counseling or intervention. If information cannot be given to the victim,
contact should be made by the deputy to one of these agencies for follow-up.

2. NCIC Check and Clearance Requirements:

a.  In all cases where an arrested person is not released on a summons but is
brought before a Magistrate, the arresting deputy shall initiate an NCIC wanted
check of the arrested individual.
b.  If an arrested person is entered as wanted in the NCIC, it shall be the arresting
deputy's responsibility to contact the Communication Central to arrange for NCIC
removal of the arrested person's name or notification of the arrest to the jurisdiction
that made the NCIC entry.

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.     POLICY

Observe constitutional safeguards knowledgeably and that Deputies understand the
limits of their authority.

II.    PURPOSE

Mandated authority for the enforcement of laws, to set forth guidelines concerning the
use of discretion by Deputies, and to define the authority, guidelines and circumstances
when Deputies should exercise alternatives to arrests and pretrial confinement.

III.  PROBABLE CAUSE AND REASONABLE SUSPICION

A.  Probable cause
Searches (with the few important exceptions outlined in this order) and all arrests are based
on the Deputy’s perception of probable cause. According to the U.S. Supreme Court,
"Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within their (the arresting
officers') knowledge and of which they had reasonable trustworthy information are sufficient
in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been
or is being committed."

B.  Reasonable suspicion
Reasonable suspicion involves a standard less than probable cause, generally defined by
the courts as a circumstance or collection of circumstances that would lead a trained,
experienced Deputy to believe that criminal activity may be afoot.

1. A deputy must have reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain a citizen. When a

deputy has reasonable suspicion, he or she may undertake a pat-down of a suspect’s
outer clothing for weapons and record the circumstances of the encounter.

C.  Elements of probable cause
Probable cause may be established through investigation and observation, witnesses,
confidential informants, or through anonymous sources provided that the information is
corroborated by investigation.

IV.  PROCEDURES 

A. Law-enforcement authority

1. Code of Virginia § 15.2-1609 gives Sheriff’s deputies the authority to enforce the

criminal laws of the Commonwealth and ordinances and regulations of the county in
which they are appointed.

2. § 49-1 requires that all deputies, before performing their duties, take an oath whereby
they swear to support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

B. Limitations on law enforcement authority
These are derived from statutes, federal, state, and local judicial interpretation of laws,
opinions of the attorney general, Sheriff’s office policies/rules and regulations.

Statutory limitations

These limitations include, but are not limited to:

1. Enforcement of laws outside of the county limits. § 19.2-249 thru 19.2-250 grants

authority to enforce state laws beyond the boundaries of the county. 

2. § 15.2-1725 grants the county authority to enforce laws and local ordinances on

county-owned property located outside of its boundaries.  

V.  INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS

A.   Definitions

1. An interview, as opposed to an interrogation, may be construed as any conversation

with a suspect, witness, victim, or the citizen.

2. An interrogation includes direct questioning (or its functional equivalent) about a crime
or suspected crime, as well as any words or conduct on behalf of the police that may
elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.

a. Deputies are reminded that an interrogation does not rely solely or exclusively on

words; conduct can be the “functional equivalent” of asking questions.

3. A person is in custody when a Deputy tells them that they are under arrest or being

detained.

Rights admonition

a. In order to achieve uniformity in administering Miranda warnings, Deputies shall

have access to a standardized Miranda Form or card. If the subject is deaf or
unable to speak English, the Deputy shall notify a supervisor and shall
immediately arrange to obtain an interpreter. If the subject is a Juvenile,
Deputies will take care when advising rights to ensure that the rights are
understood before obtaining a waiver of rights. If the Juvenile requests to speak
to a parent or guardian before waiving their rights, this request should be
honored. Before custodial interrogation, deputies shall advise suspects of their
rights by reading aloud from the form the following:

b. “You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can be used against you in

a court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any
questions, and to have him/her with you during questioning. If you cannot afford
a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you
decide to answer questions now, without a lawyer present, you will still have the
right to stop answering at any time. You also have the right to stop answering at

Page  257

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

any time until you talk to a lawyer.”

c. After the warning, in order to secure a waiver, the officer shall ask and receive

affirmative replies to the following question and receive waiver of rights:

d. “Do you understand each of these rights I have explained to you?”
e. “I have read or been read this statement of my rights and I understand what my
rights are. I am willing to make a statement and answer questions. I do not want
a lawyer at this time. I understand and know what I am doing. No promises or
threats have been made and no pressure or coercion of any kind has been used
against me.” 

4. After the rights have been read, understood, and the person wishes to waive them,

the deputy will have the suspect sign the waiver of rights form.  Deputies shall cease
questioning whenever the suspect invokes the right to silence or requests the
presence of counsel.  

a. Deputies shall not try to elicit incriminating evidence unless the suspect waives

the right to counsel.

b. If a suspect has invoked his or her right to silence, deputies may interrogate the
suspect if the suspect initiates communication with officers.  Before questioning,
however, deputies shall again administer Miranda warnings and shall obtain a
written waiver.

B.  Exemptions or special cases

This list is not all-inclusive:

1.  Miranda warnings do not apply to the following situations, which are non-custodial.

a.  Brief on-scene questioning.
b.  Identification procedures such as fingerprinting, conducting a lineup, sobriety
tests. 
c.  Volunteered, spontaneous statements. (Once the deputy has heard the suspect
express spontaneous incriminating statements, the deputy shall then advise the
suspect of Miranda Rights.)
d.  Brief investigative detention or stop/frisk.
e.  Roadside questioning during routine traffic stops
f.  Questioning by private persons.

2.  Public-safety exception
When a deputy urgently needs information from a suspect because lives are in imminent
danger, deputies may delay giving Miranda warnings until the deputies have received
information sufficient to dispel the emergency. Deputies are advised that a genuine,
life-threatening emergency must exist.

C.  Documentation requirements

Deputies shall document the circumstances surrounding the conduct of interrogations
and the recording of confessions. Required information includes but is not limited to the
following:
1. Location, date, time, duration of the interrogation.
2.
3. Miranda warnings given, the suspect's responses, and any waivers provided.
4. The nature and duration of any breaks or lapses during the interrogation and the

Identities of all persons present.

1. Purpose

audio and video statement.

2. Procedures

A. Monitoring will take place in the monitoring room adjacent to the interview room. 

Monitoring is possible through one way mirror and or audio and video equipment. 
Monitoring will take place when a person is being interviewed or left alone in the
interview room.

B. A second person will be needed for monitoring and recording.  This is only required

when used by the Tazewell County Sheriff's Office Personnel.

C. A search of the interview room is required.  A search of the person being
interviewed will be required before entering the interview room, if deemed
appropriate.

D. Law enforcement officers carrying of weapons in the interview room is optional
E. A key to the monitoring room is secured on the peg board in the deputies office.
F. Only trained personnel of the Tazewell County Sheriff's Office may operate the

recording equipment in the interview room.

VI.  SEARCH AND SEIZURE - Warrantless Searches

A.  Definition  
A search occurs where (1) there is a "prying into hidden places by the deputy" and (2) the
person whose premises or person is being searched has a reasonable expectation of
privacy.

B.  The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right for people to be free from unreasonable

searches and seizures of their homes, persons and things. The Supreme Court is
continuously interpreting the Fourth Amendment as it applies to police conduct. Illegally
seized items of evidence will not be admitted in court and may be cause for a lost
criminal case. Additionally, an illegally conducted search invites civil suits and criminal
prosecution. In order to ensure that Fourth Amendment rights are protected, deputies will
obtain search warrants upon probable cause in all appropriate criminal cases except for
the following circumstances.  
1. Consent searches
2. Emergency searches
3. Plain view and "plain feel"
4. Abandoned property and open fields
5.
6. When executing arrest warrants
7.
8. Pat-downs of suspicious persons 

Inventory searches of vehicles

Incident to arrest 

As a general rule, no arrest warrant or search warrant is required for an arrest in a public
place, as long as probable cause exists.

C.  Consent
A search warrant is not necessary where a person who has authority or control over the
thing or place searched consents to the search. If the person grants permission, the search
may take place. The sole justification for a consent search is the existence of knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary consent.  

Page  259

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

D.  Plain View and Plain Feel

1.  A plain-view seizure is, technically, not a search. To make a plain-view seizure of

property (contraband, fruits, or instrumentalities of the crime), two requirements must
be met:

a.  From a lawful vantage point, the officer must observe contraband left in open
view; and 
b.  It must be immediately apparent to the deputy that the items he or she observes
may be evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure.

2.  During a lawful frisk (stemming from a lawful stop), if a deputy detects an object that
is or might reasonably be an item that is contraband or other criminal evidence, then
the object may be seized. Threatening items such as weapons may always be
removed during frisks. Non-threatening items may be removed only if their
contraband or evidentiary nature is immediately apparent (the so-called "plain-feel"
rule).

F.  Abandoned property and open fields

1.  To constitute abandoned property, two conditions must apply:
Property was voluntarily abandoned the property was discarded outside the area in which
someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy.

2. Open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, but deputies must

distinguish them from curtilage, searches of which require a warrant.  Curtilage is the
area of a dwelling which is necessary, convenient, and  habitually used by the family
for domestic purposes. The extent of curtilage of a private residence is determined by
whether the area is enclosed. 

G.  Inventories of vehicles

1. The Sheriff’s Office requires deputies to inventory any lawfully impounded vehicle, or

a vehicle removed from the street and placed in sheriff's custody. Any evidence or
contraband found during the inventory may be used to formulate probable cause for a
subsequent search or arrest.  Vehicles shall be inventoried per office procedure,
which requires an inventory of the entire contents; including closed containers
(provided they can be opened without breakage).  

2. Closed containers may be examined if they are likely to contain valuable property. If

closed containers are locked or sealed, they shall not be forced open but simply
logged on the inventory form.  

3. The vehicle and its closed containers shall not be damaged.

H.  When executing arrest warrants

1. General guidance
A Deputy with an arrest warrant may search for the defendant in his or her own home
provided that the warrant was valid; the deputy searches the defendant's home (and not
someone else's); and probable cause exists that the defendant is home at the time of the
search. The search for the defendant must be limited to places where he or she might be
found.

Following the execution of an arrest warrant, deputies may undertake a "protective
sweep" of the premises where the arrest takes place without a warrant. Certain
limitations must be observed, however

a. The purpose of the protective sweep is to discover persons on the premises who

might present a danger to officers.

b. Incident to arrest, deputies may, without probable cause or reasonable

suspicion, look into closets or other spaces immediately adjoining the place of
arrest where threatening persons might be located.

c. In order to extend the protective sweep beyond closets and adjoining spaces,

deputies must have reasonable suspicion for fearing that persons may be on the
premises who pose a threat.  In such cases, the sweep is limited to examining
places where a person might hide.

1) Deputies shall carefully document their reasonable suspicion.
e. The sweep must cease when deputies have dispelled a reasonable suspicion of

danger.

(Note:  With a search warrant, a protective sweep is always justified.)

VII.  STOP AND FRISK

Section 19.2-81.2 of the Code of Virginia states a law enforcement officer may
temporarily detain a person in a public place, if reasonable suspicion exists that a crime
has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed; or the deputy
reasonably suspects that a person is illegally carrying a concealed weapon in violation of
Section 18.2-308 of the Code of Virginia.

VIII. EYEWITNESSES

A. Department personnel shall strictly adhere to established procedures for conducting

suspect lineups in order to avoid the possibility of error or of undue suggestiveness to
witnesses.

B. Department personnel shall receive initial and refresher training in lineup procedures to
establish uniformity and consistency of such procedures and to establish a high level of
competence in carrying out this important aspect of a criminal investigation . Refresher
training will be conducted annually by all personnel. 

C. Personnel shall report any known errors, flaws or non-conformance with established

procedures in the conduct of a suspect lineup that they may observe or become aware of
to their supervisor in order that corrective actions may be taken and safeguards
established to protect the innocent.  

D. The agency will confer with the CWA in establishing lineup procedures in order to assure

the best use of this type of evidence and to assure that procedures established are
compatible with the prosecution of criminal cases.  Likewise, instructions given to
witnesses during a lineup procedure will be those established and approved in
consultation with the CWA.

Procedures:

Prior to a photo or live lineup, the investigation office should record as complete a

description as possible to the suspect provided by the eyewitness and in the
eyewitnesses own words.  This statement should also include information regarding
conditions under which the eyewitness observed the suspect including location, time,

Page  261

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

distance, obstructions, lighting, weather conditions and other impairments, including but
not limited to alcohol, drugs, stress, the presence of a weapon and any other relevant
conditions.  The eyewitness should also be asked if  she/he wears glasses or contact
lenses and whether or not they were being worn at the time of the offense.

Show-up Procedure:

A. Show-ups should only be performed using a live suspect and only in exigent

circumstances that require the immediate display of a suspect to an eyewitness. 

B. Investigators should not conduct a show-up with a single photograph; if investigators
want to determine if a eyewitness can make an identification using a photo, a photo
lineup should be employed.  

C. The eyewitness should be transported to a neutral, non-law enforcement location where

the suspect is being detained for the purposes of a show-up.
D. The eyewitness should be provided the following instructions:

1. The suspect may or may not be the person that is presented to the eyewitness;
2. The eyewitness should not feel compelled to make an identification; 
3. The investigation will continue regardless of whether an identification is made;
4. The procedure requires the investigator to ask the eyewitness to state, in his or her
own words, how certain she/he is of the identification she/he has made; and
5.  The eyewitness should not discuss the identification procedure with other
eyewitnesses involved in the case and should not speak to the media. 

E. If there are multiple eyewitnesses, only one eyewitness at a time should participate in the

show-up procedure, independent of the others.  If a positive identification is made, and
an arrest is justified, additional eyewitnesses should be shown live or photo lineups.  
F. If identification is made, the investigator should seek and document a clear statement

from the eyewitness at the time of the identification and in the eyewitness's own words,
as to the eyewitness's confidence level that the person identified is the suspect.  

G. Investigators should photograph the suspect at the time and place of the show-up to

preserve a record of his or her appearance at the time of the show-up. 

Folder Shuffle Method 

The "Folder System" was devised to address concerns surrounding limited personnel

resources while allowing for blind administration.  Should the investigating officer of a
particular case be the only law enforcement personnel available to conduct a photo
lineup, the following instructions are recommended:

a. Obtain one (1) suspect photograph that resembles the description of the suspect
provided by the witness.
b. Obtain five (5) filler photographs that match the description of the suspect, but do not
cause the suspect photograph to unduly stand out.
c. Obtain ten (10) file folders, (four of the folders will not contain any photos and will
serve as "dummy folders"

1. Number the outside of each folder #1 thru #10.
2. Affix one (1) Filler photograph to the inside of folder #1.
3. The officer administering the lineup should affix the suspect photograph and the
other four (4) filler photographs into folders #2 thru #6 and shuffle the folders so
that the administrator is unaware of which folder the suspect is in.  

4. The remaining folders #7 thru #10 will contain a page with the following text:  " THIS
FOLDER INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK." ( This is done so that the witness does

Page  262

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

not know when she/ he has seen the last photo.  Agencies may choose to include
up the eight (8) photographs instead of the recommended six (6).  When
increasing the number of photographs, it is necessary to increase the number of
blank folders.  The intent is that the witness is not aware of when the last photo is
being presented)

5. The administrator should provide these instructions to the witness.  The witness
would be informed that the suspect may or may not be contained in the photos
she/he is about to see and that the administrator does not know which folder
contains the suspect's photo.

6. Without looking at the photo in the folder, the administrator is to hand each folder to

the witness individually.  The witness must view the photo in the folder and then
return it to the administrator before being presented with the next folder.  The order
of photos should be preserved, in a facedown position, in order to document in
STEP 7 .  ( The witness may be permitted to review the folders a second time, but
it is imperative that all folders are provided in the same order as the original
presentation.)

7. Instruct the witness that if identification is made, the procedure requires the

investigator to ask the witness to state, in his/her own words, how certain he/she is
of any identification at the time that the identification is made. 

8. The administrator should then document and record the results of the procedure. 

This should include; 
a. Date, time and location of the lineup procedure
b. The name of the administrator
c. The names of all individuals present during the lineup
d. The number of photos shown
e. Copies of the photographs themselves
f. The order in which the folders were presented
g. The sources of all the photos that were used
h. A statement of confidence In the witness's own words as to the certainty of
his/her identification taken immediately upon reaction to viewing. NO NUMERICAL
RATING OF THEIR CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS ALLOWED!
i. Any additional information the administrator deems pertinent to the procedure. 

Photo Lineup Procedure 

A. The investigator in charge should select an individual to serve as the Blind Administrator. 

The blind administrator must not know which member of the lineup is the "true" suspect
to conduct any lineups in order to avoid inadvertent signs or body language that may lead
or cause a witness to make an incorrect identification.  The blind administrator should be
thoroughly familiar with this procedure.  (Alternatively, a "blinded" administrator may be
used, namely and individual who knows the suspect's identity but is not in a position to
see which members of the lineup are being viewed by the eyewitness.  This can be
accomplished, for instance, through the use of the folder shuffle method or by laptop
technology.)

B. Assure that law enforcement and/or prosecutorial personnel present and involved in the
case are knowledgeable about the procedure so that they will not interfere or influence
any witness during the process.  Unnecessary personnel should be removed from the
location where the process is being conducted.

C. A photo lineup should be composed so the fillers generally resemble the eyewitness's

description of the suspect, while ensuring that the lineup is comprised in such a manner
that the suspect does not unduly stand out from the fillers.  However, complete uniformity

Page  263

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

of features is not required.   Avoid reusing filler photos lineup members.  If the
eyewitness has previously viewed a photo lineup in connection with the identification of
another person suspected of involvement in the offense, the fillers in the lineup should be
different from the fillers used in prior lineups. 

D. When there are multiple suspects, each identification procedure would include only one

E. Avoid mixing color and black and white photos.  Photos should either be all black and

suspect.

white or all color.

F. Cover any portions of mugshots or other photographs that provide identifying information.

Ensure that no writings of information concerning pervious arrests will be visible to the
witness.  If it is necessary to block out or cover a notation, such as a name on one photo,
then similar blocking out or covering marks should be placed on all photos so that they
will appear alike.

G. Use photos of the same size and basic composition, and never mix mugshots with other

snapshots or include more than one photo of the same suspect.  

H. Select fillers who generally fit the witness's description of the suspect.  When there is a

limited or inadequate description of the offender provided by the witness, or when the
description of the offender differs significantly from the appearance of the suspect, fillers
should resemble the suspect in significant features.  

I.  Select a photo that resembles the suspect's description or appearance at the time of the
incident, if multiple photos of the suspect are reasonably available to the investigator.  

J. Ensure that the photos are reasonably contemporary.  
K. Include a minimum of five (5) fillers (non-suspects) per photo identification procedure.
L. Create a consistent appearance between the suspect and fillers so that the photos depict

individuals who are reasonably similar in age, height, weight, and general appearance,
and are of the same sex and race.  However, avoid using fillers who so closely resemble
the suspect that a person familiar with the suspect might find it difficult to distinguish the
suspect from the fillers. 

M. If there are multiple eyewitnesses, each witness should view the lineup independently

and separately and the suspect should be placed in a different position in the photo
lineup for each eyewitness.

N. Review the array, once completed, to ensure that the suspect does not unduly stand out.
O. Assign each photo a lineup identification number.  Record the identification number on

the back of each photo.  Refer to that photo only by that number.  The nature of the
identification number should be purposely complex to the witness, so that any inadvertent
glance should not significantly hinder the identification process or alert the witness as to
the identity of the actual suspect.  (For example: Case number plus #01, #02, #03, #04,
#05, #06, etc)

P. After each photo has been assigned an identification number, record the number along

with all other pertinent information on the Lineup Identification Form.

Q. Record the presentation order of each lineup and ensure that a complete written record

of the identification proceeding is made and retained.  The record should include:
a. All identification and non-identification results obtained during the procedure and
signed by the eyewitness, including the eyewitness's confidence statement
b. The names of all the persons present at the identification procedure
c. The date and time of the identification procedure
d. The sources of all photos used in the identification procedure
e. The photos themselves should be preserved in their original condition

Conducting the Identification Procedure 

Page  264

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

A. The identification procedure should be conducted in a manner that promotes the

accuracy, reliability, fairness and objectivity of the witness's identification.  These steps
are designed to ensure the accuracy of identification or non-identification decisions.

B. Assure that all law enforcement and /or prosecutorial personnel present and involved in

the case are knowledgeable about the procedure so that they will not interfere or
influence any witness during the process. Unnecessary personnel should be removed
from the location where the process is being conducted.  

C. When presenting the lineup, the person administering the lineup should use the approved
standard instructions for witnesses prior to the lineup that the offender might or might not
be among those in the photo array and therefore, the witness should not feel compelled
to make identification.

D. Assure the witness prior to the lineup that regardless of whether identification is made,

the investigation will continue.

E. Instruct the witness that if the offender is seen in the lineup, he/she might not appear

exactly the same as on the date of the incident because features such as clothing head
or facial hair could change, and additionally, photos do not always depict the true
complexion of a person, which may be lighter or darker than shown in the photo.  Be
careful not to imply or lead the witness to believe that the suspect's appearance has
actually changed in any way.

F. Provide the following additional viewing instructions to the witness: 

a. Individual photos will be viewed one at a time.
b. Photos are in random order.
c. Take as much time as needed in making a decision about each photo
d. All photos will be shown, even if identification is made prior to viewing all photos.
e. The administrator does not know who the suspect is. 

G. Confirm that the witness understands the nature of the sequential procedure.
H. Instruct the witness that the procedure, ONLY IF IDENTIFICATION IS MADE, requires
the investigator to ask the witness to state in his/her own words how certain he/she is of
any identification at the time that the identification is made.

I. Present each photo to the witness separately, in a previously determined order, as

documented on the lineup worksheet, removing those previously shown.

J. Care should be taken to avoid the witness turning over the photo and reading the

identification number recorded on the back.

K. Avoid saying anything to the witness that may influence the witness's selection.
L. If identification is made, avoid reporting or confirming to the witness any information

regarding the individual she/he selected until the entire process (including obtaining a
confidence statement and obtaining required signatures and paperwork has been
completed.

M. If the witness requests to view the photo sequence again, (or specific photos again), they
may be shown a second time, but must be shown again the same sequence in its entirety
even if the witness makes an identification during the second showing.

N. Instruct the witness not to discuss the identification procedure or its results with other

witnesses involved in the case and discourage contact with the media.

Procedures for Recording Identification Results   

A. When conducting an identification procedure, the person administering the lineup shall

preserve the outcome of the procedure by documenting any identification or
non-identification results obtained from the witness.  A complete and accurate record of
the outcome of the identification procedure is crucial.  This record can be a critical
document in the investigation and any subsequent court proceedings.

Page  265

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

B.  When documenting the identification procedure, the person administering the lineup

should record both identification and non-identification results, including a statement of
confidence in the eyewitness's own works (the results should not be ranked).

C. If the eyewitness makes an identification, the administrator shall seek and document a

clear statement from the eyewitness, at the time of the identification and in the
eyewitness's own words, as to the eyewitness's confidence level that the person
identified in a given identification procedure.  (The administrator will not ask for a
numerical rating for the confidence level)

D. If the eyewitness identifies a person as the perpetrator, the eyewitness shall not be

provided any information concerning such person before the administrator obtains the
eyewitness's confidence statement about the selection.  After the eyewitness's
confidence statement is obtained, the administrator shall not tell the eyewitness
information about how accurate they were in their identification or provide additional
information about the suspect. 

E. Document in writing the photo lineup procedures, including identification information and
sources of all photos used, names of all persons present at the lineup, and date and time
of the identification procedure.

F. Ensure that the results are signed and dated by the witness and the person administering

the lineup.

witness.

G. Ensure that no materials indicating pervious identification results are visible to the

H. Ensure that the witness does not write on or mark any materials that will be used in other

identification procedures.  

 

IX.  VEHICLES

Warrantless searches of vehicles may take place under many conditions and circumstances. It
is imperative that deputies understand the different types of vehicle searches and their
limitations.

Definitions

A. For the purposes of this section, a motor vehicle is any vehicle operating or capable of

being operated on public streets or highways, from trucks to automobiles to mobile
homes. A vehicle that has been immobilized in one location for use as a storage facility
or home is not a motor vehicle for Fourth Amendment purposes.

B. For the purposes of this section, a search is an examination of a motor vehicle with an

investigative motive, that is, to discover evidence or to examine the vehicle identification
number (VIN) to ascertain ownership.

X.  CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  GENERAL

A.  Compliance with constitutional requirements during criminal investigations

1.  All Deputies, when conducting criminal investigations shall take all precautions
necessary to ensure that all persons involved are afforded their constitutional
protections. Deputies shall ensure that:

a. All statements or confessions are voluntary and non-coercive.
b. All persons are advised of their rights in accordance with this general order.
c. All arrested persons are taken promptly before a magistrate for formal charging.
d. All persons accused or suspected of a criminal violation for which they are being

interrogated are afforded an opportunity to consult with an attorney.

e. Prejudicial pre-trial publicity of the accused is avoided so as not to interfere with

Page  266

a defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial.  

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-17 Limits of Authority
 

B.  The use of discretion by deputies

1.  Deputies, by the nature of their job, are required to exercise discretion in the

performance of their duties. The office provides deputies with written policies, rules,
office orders, directed assignments, and training in order to aid them in making
decisions which govern discretion in performing their duties.

2. With the exception of rules and regulations, general orders give deputies procedures
to follow for common or critical enforcement tasks. By definition, general orders afford
deputies a window of discretion within which to act. General orders are to be followed
unless unusual or extreme circumstances dictate another course of action. In this
case, deputies shall make reasoned decisions in their discretion based on good
judgment, experience, and training. It is up to the individual deputy to consider the
relevant facts, the situation, and then, using knowledge, training, and good judgment,
make appropriate decisions. Supervisors must closely observe the use of discretion
by their subordinates and point out factual errors or alternatives that may be more
appropriate.

C.  Alternatives to arrest/pre-arraignment confinement

1. Under certain circumstances, deputies are faced with situations where an arrest and
pre-arraignment confinement will not be possible.  In such cases, deputies may elect
to exercise certain alternatives such as the issuance of summonses, referral to a
social service agency, or simply to give a warning.

2. Authority to issue summonses in lieu of arrest/confinement

a. § 19.2-74 authorizes deputies to issue a summons in lieu of arrest for persons
charged with a misdemeanor criminal offense except D.U.I. and drunk in public.
Additionally, § 19.2-74 authorizes the use of summonses when enforcing county
ordinances.

b. In determining whether a summons should be used, the deputy shall:
1) Decide whether the offense committed is serious.
2) Make a judgment as to whether the accused poses a danger to the public or

3) Decide, based on circumstances, whether the person may disregard a

himself.

summons.

3. Use of warnings as an alternative to arrest
The use of warnings may sometimes provide a solution to a problem and may enhance
the public perception of the sheriff’s office. Normally, the use of a warning occurs in
traffic offenses.

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY

The Deputy's authority to search without a warrant comes automatically from a lawful arrest.

II.   PURPOSE

Guidelines for the search of person(s) who are placed under arrest and taken into custody
and to ensure that Deputies adhere to Constitutional Guidelines.

A.  DEFINITIONS

1. Strip search  

A search of a person requiring the removal or rearrangement of some or all clothing to
permit the visual inspection of any or all skin surfaces and the undergarments.  A strip
search shall only be conducted at the jail or lock-up and shall be witnessed only by
deputies or jail personnel of the same sex.

2. Body-cavity search

A search involving not only visual inspection of skin surfaces but the internal physical
examination of body cavities and, in some instances, organs such as the stomach
cavity. A medically qualified person under sanitary conditions shall only perform a
body-cavity search. A body-cavity search may take place at a jail or lock-up if these
criteria are satisfied.

III.  PROCEDURE
A.  General

The general rule is that a reasonable search may follow a valid arrest. The deputy has
the authority to make a search that may extend to articles carried by the suspect and to
the suspect's immediate surroundings. Although an arrestee who is handcuffed at the
time of search cannot reasonably reach into the area being searched, the search of the
area is still legally justified.

B.  Time and place of search incident to an arrest

A search incident to an arrest must occur in such a way that it and the arrest are part of a
continuous, uninterrupted transaction. Two conditions are necessary for this to occur:
1. The search must be made as soon as practical after the arrest.
2. The search must be made at or near the place of the arrest.

Page  268

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-18 Search Incident to Arrest 
 

C.  When a search before an arrest is valid

A search incident to an arrest is mandatory following the arrest.

A search before an arrest is valid only if;

1.  Probable cause for the arrest existed before the search began, and
2.  The search and arrest occur almost at the same time.

D.  Use of force

The deputy conducting a search incident to an arrest is permitted to use whatever degree
of force is reasonable and necessary at the time of the arrest.  If the deputy used an
unreasonable amount of force under the existing circumstances, the search is unlawful.

E.  Scope of Search

The deputy making a search incident to an arrest may search only the following
permissible places:

.

1. The entirety of the person being arrested.
2. The area within the immediate control of the person being arrested into which the

suspect might reach for a weapon or for evidence. The purpose of this search must
be to:

a. Protect the deputy.
b. Prevent escape.
c. Prevent the destruction of evidence

3. Accessories carried by the suspect may be searched incident to a full custodial arrest;

for they are within the area in which the defendant might reach to grab a weapon or
an item of evidence.  

4. Vehicles may be searched contemporaneous with the arrest of the occupant or driver.

The search shall be conducted as soon as practicable following the arrest.

a. A contemporaneous search of the entire passenger compartment may be

undertaken incident to the arrest of the occupant or driver, even if the driver or
occupant is not in the vehicle at the time of the search.

b. A search undertaken pursuant to “a” includes any container found within the

passenger compartment. A container is any object capable of holding another
object.

F.  Strip searches

Strip and body cavity searches are governed by  § 19.2-59.1.  

1. Strip searches shall not be conducted of persons arrested for traffic violations, Class

3 or 4 misdemeanors, or violations of city, county, or town ordinances, which are
punishable by less than 30 days in jail, unless the deputy has an articulable,
reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is concealing a weapon.  Reasonable
suspicion may be based on, but is not limited to, the following criteria.

a. Nature of the offense.
b. Arrestee's demeanor and appearance.
c. Circumstances of the arrest or evidence of a major offense in plain view or

during the course of the arrest.

d. Arrestee's criminal record, particularly a history of narcotics offenses or violence.
e. Detection of suspicious objects beneath the suspect's clothing during a search

incident to an arrest.

Page  269

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-18 Search Incident to Arrest 
 

2. Strip searches shall be performed by persons of the same sex as the person arrested

and at the jail or lock-up where the search cannot be observed by persons not
physically conducting the search. In any event, the on-duty supervisor must expressly
authorize the strip search.

a. A strip search in the field shall only be conducted under exigent circumstances
where the life of the deputy or others is at risk and the on-duty supervisor has
expressly authorized it.

b. When authorized, the strip search shall be performed in a room designed for the

purpose, by the least number of same-sex personnel present as necessary, in
conformance with approved hygienic practices, and under circumstances that
provide privacy from all but those authorized to conduct the search.

G.  Body-cavity searches

1. Body-cavity searches other than the mouth shall be conducted only when there is

probable cause to believe a particular prisoner may be concealing contraband within a
body cavity or otherwise on the suspect's person. Body-cavity searches shall only be
conducted under the express direction of the Chief Deputy/Sheriff.
If appropriate, upon authority of the Sheriff, or a divisional commander, the deputy
shall seek a search warrant and shall prepare the necessary affidavit. Body cavity
searches shall be conducted without a warrant only in extreme emergencies to protect
the lives of prisoners or to prevent serious breaches of security.

3. The body-cavity search shall be performed only by a licensed physician or other

2.

medically trained person as directed by the physician.

4. The process of conducting the body-cavity search shall involve the same safeguards

for privacy and hygiene as for strip searches.

5. Body-cavity search procedures.

a. The deputy shall inform the prisoner of his or her intention to conduct a
body-cavity search thus giving the prisoner the opportunity to voluntarily
surrender the suspected contraband.

b. The prisoner shall remove every article of clothing including wigs and dentures

and shall give them to the deputy for inspection.

c. Should the prisoner resist the cavity search and become violent, additional

deputies of the same sex as the prisoner shall restrain the prisoner and assist in
stripping. Only sufficient force, necessary under the circumstances, shall be
applied to complete the search.

d. Should a prisoner resist a cavity search and an insufficient number of same-sex
deputies are available to restrain the prisoner, the following procedures shall be
followed:

1) Deputies of the opposite sex may assist in subduing the prisoner before the

prisoner is stripped.

2) Deputies shall subdue the prisoner and apply the necessary restraints

(handcuffs, shackles, etc.), then leave the room.

H.  What may be seized

things:

1. During a search incident to an arrest, the deputy may seize any of the following

a. Anything in the permissible area that is evidence of the offense for which the

deputy has probable cause to make the arrest.

b. Anything in the permissible area that is evidence of any other offense.
c. Anything else that is outside the permissible area that is evidence of the offense
for which the deputy makes the arrest or of any other offense if the evidence is in

plain view of the spot where that deputy makes the arrest.

V.  SEARCHES OF PRISONERS - PROCEDURES

The Office advocates the following method of searching arrested persons:

1. When feasible, have another deputy present before conducting the search, to act as a

fingers.  

2. Place the suspect with hands high on a wall or other vertical surfaces.  
3. Do not allow the suspect to place palms flat on the wall: have the suspect extend the

4. The feet should be positioned one of two ways. The first method is to separate the

feet wide apart; the other is to make the suspect cross his or her legs. The suspect's
legs should be far enough away from the wall so that the suspect would not have
significant balance to push away from the wall with any force.  

5. The suspect's back should be in a straight line with the legs and not be arched.  
6. When searching the suspect's left side, the deputies left leg should be placed aligned
with the middle of the suspect's back. With proper hand and foot location, the deputy
maintains complete control. With this approach, the deputy searches with one hand.

B.  Search the following
When searching a suspect incident to an arrest, search all of the following places:

1. Hair
2. Open mouth (have suspect open mouth; deputy checks visually)
3. Collar
4. Back of neck, the ears, and behind the ears

I.    POLICY

Deputies will sensitively collect facts leading to identification, arrest, and prosecution of
sexual offenders.

II.   PURPOSE

To properly investigate sex crimes and the function of the Deputies in these high priority
cases.

III.  PROCEDURE

A. General Responsibilities

1. “Sexual assault” means those offenses involving sexual penetration or sexual contact
with any person by force or threat of force, fear, intimidation, ruse, or through the use
of a person’s mental incapacity, or physical helplessness, or any other attempts to
force sexual penetration/contact on any person.

2. Deputies of the Office shall be aware of community services available to victims of

sexual assault, including sexual assault crisis/hotlines, mental health centers, forensic
nurse programs, and a victim assistance program.

3. Deputies of the Office shall be trained and knowledgeable about sexual assault

investigation and its impact on victims.

4. Deputies of the Office shall use appropriate communication skills when interacting

with sexual assault victims. 

B.  Dispatcher (Communication Center) Responsibilities

1.

If hospital personnel call in the sexual assault report, the dispatcher shall obtain initial
information only (name and location of victim, reporter’s name and job title, victim’s
condition). Confirm that a Victim/ Witness Advocate or sexual assault crisis center
support person has been contacted for the victim.

Page  284

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-24 Sex Crimes  
 

2.

If the victim calls to make a report, she or he may or may not want police intervention.
If the victim is a child, this does not apply, because all crimes against children must be
investigated.
a.

If the victim wants no department response, the dispatcher shall observe the
following procedures.
1) Try to obtain as much information as possible concerning the crime details. Do

not insist on the victim’s identity, unless a victim is a child.

2) Encourage the victim to go to the hospital for treatment and evidence collection.
Advise the victim that a Deputy will meet with them there.  (The Commonwealth
of Virginia pays expenses related to the PERK exam whether or not the victim
cooperates with law enforcement. The Criminal Justice Compensation Fund
applies, per Virginia Code 19.2-368.18.)

3) Even if no report is made, refer the victim to a sexual assault crisis center,

hospital and victim/witness program for further assistance.

b.

If the victim wants  The Sheriff’s Office, the dispatcher shall observe the following:
1) Obtain initial information only such as name, present location, telephone

number, victim’s condition, and basic incident details.

2) Ensure the victim’s safety. A Deputy shall be dispatched immediately. Ask for
name of the assailant, if known, description, possible location or direction and
means of flight from the scene, and the time elapsed since the crime. Stay on
the line until the Deputy arrives, if possible.  Be supportive and use crisis
intervention skills.

3) If the assault occurred within the last ninety six (96) hours, explain to the victim
the necessity of not performing the following activities:  washing self or clothes,
brushing teeth, eating, drinking,  

4) smoking, douching, combing hair or putting on make-up, going to the toilet, and
touching or moving anything at the crime scene.  If the victim has already done
any of these things, reassure the victim, but ask not to do any more “cleanup”.
There is some possibility that evidence can be recovered even after ninety six
(96) hours. Detective should consult with a Forensic Nurse Examiner or Medical
Doctor.

5) If the assault occurred more than ninety six (96) hours earlier, recommend that

the victim seek medical attention anyway and dispatch a Deputy.

6) Ask the victim if he or she wishes the presence of a sexual assault crisis center

advocate, family member or friend for further support (as the hospital or
department), and offer to contact that person.

7) Ask if the victim has transportation or not. Have Deputy go to wherever the

victim is, if possible. Facilitate the transportation of the victim to the hospital or
department or explain that a Deputy will meet the victim at the specific location.

3. Give a complete report of information obtained to the Deputy assigned to the case

before he or she initially contacts the victim.

4. See Victim Services, dispatcher responsibilities for additional procedures.

C.  Patrol Responsibilities

1. Deputies of the Sheriff’s Office who arrived on the scene of a sex crime are
responsible for the preliminary investigation and should immediately request
notification of Detectives for assistance

Page  285

scene and through follow-up.

3. The Deputy shall obtain detailed information essential to determine what offense (or

offenses) actually occurred. When this is not possible for any reason, the Deputy shall
concentrate on obtaining information that will establish the basis for misdemeanor or
felony offenses, and help determine appropriate Sheriff’s Office response in carrying
out the arrest of any suspect.

4. Obtain preliminary statements from victim and witnesses. Try to establish rapport and

obtain information needed immediately to determine the victim’s greatest needs and
the identity and/or location of the suspect.

5. The Deputy shall inform the victim, preferably in writing, of counseling services

available in the area. (Inform the victim that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund
pays counseling and other crime-related fees, if needed.) Ask whether the victim
would prefer to have a support person (sexual assault crisis center advocate, family
member, or friend) present if this has not already been done by a dispatcher. Offer to
contact this person. 

6. The Deputy shall arrange for transportation or transport the victim to the hospital for a
sexual assault examination, if appropriate (if the assault occurred within the last ninety
six (96) hours). Explain the medical and legal advantages of this exam. Inform the
victim to take a change of clothing along. The Deputy may provide transportation back
home following the exam. If the assault occurred more than ninety six (96) hours
before, the Deputy shall still encourage the victim to seek medical help.

D.  Detective Responsibilities

begin the preliminary investigation. If victim has their own transportation we allow
them to meet a Detective at the hospital.

b. At the hospital: arrange for the collection of evidence needed for prosecution.

Explain sexual assault exam procedures, and establish rapport for further
interviews. The Detective shall not be in the room during the sexual assault exam
but shall have the victim sign a consent form in order to obtain a copy of the
hospital report.

c. At the Sheriff’s Office or hospital: Before interviewing, review the Deputy’s report

and establish rapport with the victim by allowing her or him to ask preliminary
question or voice initial concerns.

3. The Detective shall be trained in sexual assault procedures.

Page  286

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-24 Sex Crimes  
 

a. The Detective shall allow the sexual assault crisis center advocate to be with the

victim for support if the victim desires. (Establishing rapport and good working
relationships with crisis center advocates as collaborating partners in advance of
actually working an incident will promote more effective interactions with a victim
when a crime does occur.)

b. Prepare the victim for each phase of the investigation. By explaining what must be

done and the reasons why, the Deputy and Detective will encourage the victim’s
cooperation.

c. The earliest possible PERK exam must be done in the interests of victim health

and safety, evidence collection and substance/drug identification.  All victims
should be encouraged to obtain this exam prior to interviews if possible, and
regardless of their current willingness to prosecute or cooperate with the Deputy’s
investigation.

4. Follow-up interviews by the Detective

a. Privacy is a necessity for follow-up interviews. Choose a quiet room free of

distractions and interruptions at the office or go to the victim’s home.  A support
person to aid the victim may be helpful to the investigation. Advise this person of
his or her role and ask the person not to interfere with questioning.
1) It is not appropriate to submit a victim to a polygraph exam. The Detective

should anticipate some confusion, memory suppression or reluctance to discuss
fear-inducing or humiliating details of the incident. This information should be
obtained by patient, supportive rapport building, not by questioning a victim’s
truthfulness or motives.

2) A false report should never be brought against a victim on grounds that the

victim is hesitant or fearful to cooperate with the investigation.

3) Avoid asking “why questions” that sound accusatory or judgmental about the

victim’s actions or behavior prior to the assault.  

4) Ask “how questions” instead.

b. Questions which must be addressed include the following:

1) Assault circumstances:  Where approached?  How?  Where occurred? When?
2) Assailant:  Name, if known?  Age?  Race?  Color of hair?  Clothing?  Height? 

Weight?  Identifying marks?  Relationship to victim, if any?

3) Multiple assaults occur?  Other crimes committed?
4) What happened during the assault?  Were weapons used?  Describe them. 

Were threats made?  What were they?  Was there a fight or struggle?  Injuries
sustained?  Drugs/alcohol involved?  Was the victim incapacitated in any way? 
Sexual detail- what did he do?  Did he ejaculate?  What was said?

5) How long was assailant with victim?
6) What did victim or the assailant do immediately after the attack?
7) Concerns about prosecuting?

c. At the conclusion of the interview, the Detective shall ask about any additional
assistance needed. Counseling services are always recommended. Refer the
victim to the local sexual assault crisis center advocate and victim assistance
program.

d.

Inform the victim that it is common to remember additional details later. Encourage
the victim to call if that happens or to ask questions. Give a number.

Page  287

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-24 Sex Crimes  
 

e. As soon as practical, alert the Victim/Witness Assistance Program that a sexual
assault has occurred. Provide the information necessary for staff to contact the
victim.

E.  Third Party Reports for Sex Crimes

Certain other agencies, such as Social Services, provide counseling and other services to
victims of sexual assaults. Such agencies will encourage victims to make reports to the
Sheriff’s Office so that prompt and complete investigative follow up action may be taken.

F.  Evidence Collection- Sexual Assaults

1. General Rules

a. Safeguard crime scene and evidence that is collected.
b. Use caution not to damage, mark, or contaminate evidence.
c.
d. Document chain of evidence in report.
e. Place all evidence in appropriate containers, seal, and initial.

Initial and date all items seized.

2. At the crime scene

a. Remember that evidence collection is intended not only to identify the criminal, but

also to discover the exact manner in which the crime was committed, influencing
preparation before and actions taken afterward to avoid detection. Evidence can
also corroborate the victim’s account of the assault. During evidence collection,
keep in mind that you know from the victim about the manner in which the crime
occurred. Also be alert to evidence that can tell you details that the victim does not
know or remember.

b. DNA evidence is now one of the most important and reliable forms of physical
evidence establishing the presence of a suspect at a crime scene. Any form of
bodily fluid or other trace evidence may be used to identify the suspect’s genetic
identifiers (hair, skin, saliva, semen, etc.).  Even when the identity of the suspect is
not in questions, as in acquaintance rape cases, the presence of DNA and of trace
evidence may be important to corroborating the victim’s account of the incident.

c. Collect undergarments, clothing, bedding, rugs, smoking materials, or other

appropriate items that may contain semen, blood, saliva, hairs, fibers, or other
pieces of trace evidence, or items that might be damaged.

d. Collect washcloths or towels that may have been used.
e. Collect bottles, glasses, or other objects that may contain latent prints.
f. Search scene for foreign objects (buttons, hair, pieces of torn clothing).
g.

If crime occurred outdoors, take soil samples from several areas and sketch the
location of each sample taken. Look for footprints or tire tracks or other physical
signs that may be tied to a specific shoe, car, or other object.
If crime occurred in a car, gather sweeping from seats and floors, search floor
mats and seat covers for stains. It is often advisable to seize the vehicle so that a
thorough search for evidence may be conducted by an evidence technician in a
controlled environment.
If entry was forced into the victim’s residence, gather samples of broken glass,
paint samples, and note any pry marks or other signs of forced entry.

h.

i.

j. Photograph crime scene and physical evidence before collecting it.
k. Photograph bite marks, scratch marks, or other signs of brutality or injury to victim.
Only female officers or medical personnel should photograph private sexual areas
of female victims and children.

Page  288

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-24 Sex Crimes  
 

l. Proof of physical resistance by the victim is not required. However, evidence
indicating that a victim resisted, if it exists, must be preserved and gathered
properly.

3. Notes to be prepared

a. Prepare a diagram and a detailed description of exact location where each piece
of evidence was found. With multiple items of evidence, numbering each one will
make it easier to complete a detailed diagram of the scene.

b. Description of victim’s appearance and behavior. 
c. Description of victim’s clothing.  
d. Description of suspect.  Physical description as provided by a victim with special
attention to details, which would not be readily visible if the suspect wore clothed
(scars, tattoos, moles).

e. Have all signs of trauma or injury, as all are  emotional state of the victim,

recorded on hospital record. Review the examination with examining medical staff
person to be certain that smears are taken from vagina, anus, and mouth of victim,
as dictated by the nature of the assault. It is not necessary for maintaining the
chain of evidence, and it is not appropriate for a Deputy to be present at the time
of the PERK exam. The victim needs privacy to get through this experience and
the Deputy lacks the expertise to testify regarding the exam done by medical
professionals.

Brian Hieatt, Sheriff

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY 

Deputies shall observe constitutional guidelines when conducting searches and always
remain mindful of their lawful purpose. Search Warrants, in particular, are one of the
most valuable and powerful tools available to law-enforcement officers. Because of the
potential harm to citizens, the risks to Deputy's safety, and to the Department image in
the community, Deputies shall have a thorough knowledge of the legal requirements in
obtaining search warrants.

II.   PURPOSE

To set guidelines and procedures, which police officers must follow when conducting
searches and seizures.

III.  DEFINITIONS

A.  Search warrant  
A written order, signed by a judicial authority, directing a police officer to search for specified
personal (or business) property and bring it before the judicial officer.

B.  Curtilage  
Curtilage usually refers to the yard, garden, or piece of ground which adjoins a private
residence. While the term has no absolute definition that applies under all circumstances,
the curtilage of a private residence, for instance, is determined by whether the area is
enclosed; the nature and use of the area; the proximity of the area to the home; and any
measures taken by the owner to protect the area from observation. 

IV.  PROCEDURES - GENERAL

A.  Legal authorities

1. Virginia Code § 19.2-52 states that a Judge or Magistrate may issue a Search

Warrant if the following circumstances exist:

a. There is a reasonable and probable cause to do so.
b. There is a complaint on oath supported by an affidavit.

2. § 19.2-53 states that Search Warrants may be issued for the search of or for

Page  290

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-25 Search Warrants 
 

specified places, things or persons, and seizure there from of the following things as
specified in the warrant:

a. Weapons or other objects used in the commission of a crime.
b. Articles or things the sale or possession of which is unlawful.
c. Stolen property or the fruits of any crime.
d. Any object, thing, or person including documents, books, records, paper, or body

fluids constituting evidence of a crime.

3. Supreme Court decisions
The Supreme Court of the United States issues decisions which must be used as
guidelines in conducting searches. Because the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution
prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, officers bear the burden of proving that
the search was reasonable. The court will examine reasonableness according to the
answers to these questions:

a. Was there probable cause to issue the search warrant?
b. Was the scope of the search appropriate?

4. Exceptions to search warrant requirements
(Refer to Limits of Authority Policy/ Search and Seizure)

V.   PROCEDURES – OBTAINING A SEARCH WARRANT

A. Essential legal requirements

1. To obtain a Search Warrant, an officer must show probable cause to believe that

specific evidence, contraband, or fruits of a crime may be found at a particular place.

2. The officer shall carefully document specific facts that constitute probable cause. Two

kinds of facts must be considered:

a. The facts from which the officer concluded that the person or thing is probably

located at the place to be searched.

b. The facts which address the reliability of the source of the officer's information.

3. The court considers only those facts presented in the warrant and affidavit.

4. Conclusions and suspicions are not facts.

5. Facts must be recent.

6. Apart from the officer's personal knowledge or observations, facts may derive from a

reliable informant.  

7. Reliability of facts is established by:

a. Personal observation or knowledge by an officer.
b. Eyewitnesses who have first-hand knowledge.
c. Informants 

B.  Where to obtain a search warrant

 A Search Warrant may be obtained from any of the following three sources, according to

§ 19.2-52:
1. Any Judge.

Page  291

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-25 Search Warrants 
 

2. Any Magistrate.

3. Any other person having the authority to issue criminal warrants.

C.  Affidavits

1.  The accuracy of the affidavit is vital to the validity of the Search Warrant. On the

designated form, officers shall provide the information listed below.  § 19.2-54
requires officers to swear to the facts of the affidavit before a Judge or Magistrate.
Note that the Search Warrant must be obtained in the jurisdiction where the place or
person to be searched is located.

2. The affidavit shall include the following elements:

a. A detailed description of the place, thing, or person to be searched, including

map coordinates or distances from given reference points, if necessary.

b. A description of the things or persons to be searched for.
c. A substantial allegation of the offense in relation to which the search is to be

d. An allegation that the object, thing, or person to be searched constitutes

evidence of the commission of the offense.

e. Material facts which would show that there is probable cause for issuing the

made.

search warrant.

3. Language of the warrant
Only the things specified in the Search Warrant can be seized (exceptions to this, such
as plain-view seizures and searches incident to arrest.  The warrant shall specify the
following.

specify.

a. The areas to be searched shall be precisely stated. If officers wish to search a

home and its surroundings, the affidavit must specify a “premises” search and its
curtilage and must identify outbuildings, garages, as appropriate.

b. If motor vehicles to be searched are on the premises, the warrant shall so

c. If searches of specific persons (other than frisks) are to be included during the

search, the warrant shall so specify. If the warrant states that all persons present
shall be searched, then probable cause to do so must be justified in the affidavit.

d. The items to be searched for shall be precisely described. If an item to be

searched for may be dismantled (e.g., firearms), then the warrant must specify
the search for parts, pieces, or components of the item.

e. If officers anticipate searching for and seizing computers or similar, complex

technology, then experts must be consulted to determine the appropriate
language to list in the affidavit and for outlining appropriate guidelines in the
warrant for seizure of hardware and software.

VI.  PROCEDURES – EXECUTING A SEARCH WARRANT

A.  When a search warrant must be executed

1. An officer is required by § 19.2-56 to execute a warrant within 15 days of the date it

was issued. If it has not been executed during that time, the officer shall void the
warrant and return it to the magistrate who issued it.

2. A copy of the affidavit must be attached to the warrant and served with it.

Page  292

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-25 Search Warrants 
 

3. An officer may execute a search warrant either during the day or at night.

B.  Preparing to execute the warrant
Before executing the warrant, the on-duty supervisor shall review the warrant and the
affidavit, brief the search team officers on the procedures to be followed. The supervisor
shall ensure that the entire warrant process is documented. Written reports shall be
supplemented with photographs or videotape, if available and appropriate.

C.  Gaining entrance to premises  

1. The search team shall first deploy around the premises to be searched, ensuring that

all exits are covered. Uniformed officers shall be the most visible members of the
search team and shall conduct the entry.

2.

In most cases the officer shall do all of the following before entering the premises to
be searched:

a. He or she must announce his presence as a law-enforcement officer.
b. The officer must announce that his purpose is to execute a search warrant.
c. The officer must wait a reasonable time either to be admitted or refused

admission to the premises.

3. When entrance is refused
If the officer is refused entrance after a reasonable time, he may force his way into the
premises using force applicable to the circumstances.  "Reasonable time" in this context
depends on the circumstances. A refusal may be expressed or implied. A refusal can be
implied in two circumstances:

a. No one has admitted the officer within a time in which it would be reasonable to

expect someone to let the officer in if he or she is going to be admitted at all.

b. The officer waiting to be admitted sees or hears suspicious circumstances, such

as flushing toilets or footsteps running away from the door, which indicate that
someone might be concealing or destroying evidence or trying to escape.

4. No-knock or exigent entry
In some circumstances a police officer may enter the premises to be searched without
announcing his or her presence and purpose before entering. The judicial authority
issuing the warrant may add a no-knock entry provision to the warrant. If not, the decision
to make a no-knock entry shall be made by the on-scene supervisor based on facts that
would lead him or her to believe that an announcement would result in:

a. Bodily harm either to the officer or to someone within the premises to be

searched.

b. The escape of the person to be searched or arrested.
c. The destruction of evidence.

5.  If circumstances require a no-knock or exigent entry, then the first officer to cross the

threshold into the premises shall announce that law-enforcement officers are
executing a warrant. Officers shall also command the occupants to take the
appropriate action to ensure their safety.  Sample commands:

a.  "Deputy Sheriff, search warrant, get down."
b.  "Deputy Sheriff, search warrant, stay where you are." 
c.  "Deputy Sheriff, search warrant, put your hands up."

Page  293

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-25 Search Warrants 
 

6.

In executing any warrants, officers may use whatever force is reasonably necessary
under the circumstances to effect a lawful purpose.

D.  Conduct of the search

1. Once evidence being searched for is located, the search must cease at that point.

2. Officers shall not use a search warrant to conduct a fishing expedition, i.e., if the

search warrant is for a television, or large item, small places such as jewelry boxes
may not be searched.

3. An officer may seize only the property listed in the warrant with two exceptions:

a. The other evidence is reasonably related to the offense for which the search

b. It is property which the officer knows or has probable cause to believe is

warrant was issued.

evidence of another crime.  

E.  Searches of persons found on premises

1. A person's presence on the premises to be searched with a warrant does not, without

more, give rise to probable cause to search that person beyond a frisk for officers'
safety.

2. A warrant to search the premises for contraband does carry with it the authority to

detain the occupants of the premises while a search is being conducted. If the search
of the premises gives rise to probable cause to arrest the detainee, he or she may be
arrested and his or her person searched incident to arrest.

3. A person on the premises may be searched if the officer has probable cause to

believe that items listed in the warrant are concealed on the person. Mere presence
on premises does not constitute probable cause.

VII.  PROCEDURES – RETURN OF THE SEARCH WARRANT

A.  Per § 19.2-57, after an officer has finished a search, he or she shall perform the

following:
1. Note the date of execution on the search warrant.

2. Under oath, the officer must make an inventory of all the property seized.

3. Within three days of the date of the search (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or legal

holidays) file the following in the Circuit Court Clerk's Office (of the jurisdiction wherein
the search was made):

a. The Search Warrant. 
b. Either the inventory of articles seized (which must be notarized or sworn) or a

notation that nothing was seized during the search.

c. The affidavit (unless affidavit was made by voice or videotape recording).

B.  Responsibility for property seized

1. All property seized must follow a rigorous chain-of-custody procedure. Documentation

must appear in all narrative reports pertaining to the chain of custody of any items
seized.

2. Officers shall place evidence in the locker reserved for the purpose or relinquished to

the Department evidence custodian to be placed into the evidence room.

3. Observe the property and evidence procedures

directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY

Any assets recovered through the forfeiture process, whether money or property, will be
applied to legitimate enforcement needs, primarily to carry out other drug enforcement
strategies. Under no circumstances will personnel select enforcement targets because of
the expected financial gain accruing to the department: enforcement strategies are not
dictated by profit.

II.   PURPOSE

To outline the Department's participation in Asset Forfeitures from drug enforcement
cases, and to state responsibilities of the Asset Forfeiture Coordinator.

III.  DEFINITIONS

A.  Asset Forfeiture Coordinator (AFC)

The AFC is the officer designated by the Sheriff to be conversant in state forfeiture law
(Virginia Code, §§ 19.2386.1 through .14), to identify assets in case records, and begin
the legal process to appropriate these assets for Department use. The AFC also
performs as liaison to other state and federal agencies, and the courts as needed.

1. The AFC shall also understand the authority of § 18.2-249 which allows for the seizure

and forfeiture of property used in narcotics trafficking.

2. The AFC shall maintain a current edition of the Forfeited Assets Seizure Manual

(FASP), published by the Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS).

B.  Designated seizing agency  

The designated seizing agency is the one which initiates the seizure or which retains
possession of the seized property. It may be the agency chosen by mutual decision of
the participating agencies.

C.  Assets 

Assets are anything of value seized in connection with a drug transaction and include
both inkind property and proceeds. Inkind property consists of whatever an agency can
put to immediate use. Proceeds refer to money that is raised through sale of property of

Page  296

A.  Responsibilities of the asset forfeiture coordinator (AFC)

1. Reviews all offense reports related to drug offenses to identify property subject to

2. Ensures that all seizures for forfeitures are reported to DCJS.

3. Reports to the immediate supervisor and the chain of command on all matters

pertaining to forfeiture proceedings.

4. Chooses and coordinates with vendors hired to manage seized property.

5. Coordinates, where possible, with other agency representatives, as designated by the

Sheriff, for "pre seizure" planning meetings to evaluate target assets to ascertain
ownership and the existence of liens or encumbrances.
a. Personnel planning a seizure of assets shall make every reasonable effort to

identify innocent lien holders to avoid inconveniencing them.

6. Coordinate with the Commonwealth's Attorney to enter a default judgment against

persons who fail to respond to the court within 30 days to defend against seizure of
their property.

7. Apply to DCJS for return of in-kind property for legitimate law enforcement use.

8. Coordinate with the Commonwealth's Attorney or other officials as necessary to obtain

a commercial sale of property in appropriate cases.

9. If the seized item was the part of an investigation jointly conducted with the Tazewell
County Narcotics Task Force or another agency; the Coordinator shall work with the
appropriate joint participating agencies to agree on which agency will become the
designated seizing agency for purposes of forfeiture proceedings. Negotiate with
participating law enforcement agencies for a suitable division of assets.
a. Where agencies seize property pursuant to membership in a regional task force,
the AFC shall forward to DCJS a copy of the interagency agreement or contract
that authorizes the task force.

b. The AFC shall assist inter-jurisdictional coordination to ensure that localities

maintain separate forfeitures, accounts, and auditing procedures.  Similarly, the
AFC shall track cases in which the department is involved but is not the primary
seizing agency.

c. Where the Department participates in federal investigations that seizures are made,

the AFC shall submit the appropriate DAG-71 form and information to make the
Department eligible for proceeds from the seizure.

10. Ensure that the Department’s certification (that the proceeds will be used for law

enforcement purposes only and will not supplant existing resources) is submitted to
DCJS, and renewed annually by the Sheriff and the County Administrator.

Page  297

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-26 Asset Forfeiture 
 

11. Ensure that seized money is forwarded to DCJS in check form. Coordinate with the

Department finance officer and County Treasurer, as necessary.

B.  The agency finance officer shall:

1. Prepare checks to DCJS as soon as possible upon receipt by the Department of

forfeited funds from drug transactions.

2. Prepare and maintain records on all property accruing to the Department through drug

forfeitures and retain these records for a minimum of three years.

3. Annually conduct an audit of all property seized attendant to drug transactions,

including an audit of all property subjected to forfeiture proceedings.  Forward a copy
of all audits to DCJS upon request.

4. Compile and retain a file of all receipts for cash or property obtained and sold or

otherwise disposed of through asset forfeitures procedures.

C.  If the agency elects to pursue forfeiture through federal proceedings, then the

AFC does not notify DCJS.

D.  Evidentiary Considerations

1. Deputies searching businesses, residences, or vehicles for narcotics evidence shall try

to obtain documents relating to the ownership of the items seized.

2. Deputies must obtain complete data on all suspects and participants when a seizure is

made. This data includes name, date of birth, race, sex, nationality, height, eye and
hair color, complete address with zip code, telephone number, Social Security
number, and any other identifying numbers such as driver's license number.

3. When interviewing suspects or participants, Deputies shall try to elicit statements of
ownership or lien holding, and origin (how did the property come into the suspect's
possession).

     NOTE:  This directive is for internal use only, and does not enlarge an officer's civil or criminal
liability  in  any  way.  It  should  not  be  construed  as  the  creation  of  a  higher  standard  of
safety or care in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party claims.  Violations of this
directive, if proven, can only form the basis of a complaint by this department, and then
only in a non-judicial administrative setting.

I.    POLICY

To investigate and enforce narcotics and dangerous drug violations at all levels.  

II.   PURPOSE

To provide investigative guidelines regarding narcotics and dangerous drug cases.

III. PROCEDURES

A.  General
Deputies shall be especially mindful of narcotics offenses commonly observed during patrol
activities and narcotics violations.  

B.  Elements of successful investigations

1. Specific offenders are targeted, and their habits, associates, vehicles, property

thoroughly investigated with surveillance as necessary.

2. A thorough incident report, not only for cases involving illegal narcotics, but also those
involving the seizure of contraband without an arrest being made shall be completed.

C.  Directed patrol
The Sheriff’s Office practices directed patrol as a method of narcotics-control strategy. The
Sheriff’s Office shall deploy the use of the Interdiction Team to execute directed patrols.

D.  Intelligence gathering 
Intelligence is gathered chiefly by observing and talking. Deputies shall employ the use of
informants, citizens, and other police officers as sources of intelligence gathering. 

Patrol personnel and Detectives shall diligently document the intelligence they have
gathered, investigations undertaken, informants developed, and any other information of
relevance. When compiling intelligence reports, officers shall at least record the following
information:

1. The frequency of occurrence by type of crime;

2. Geographic factors;

Page  299

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-27 Narcotics Enforcement  
 

3. When targeted activities occur;

4. Descriptions of targets, their associates, and their methods of operation;

5. Descriptions of vehicles.

These reports are to be given to a member of the Narcotics Enforcement Unit. The reports
will then be filed for follow-up investigations.

E. Surveillance and arrest 
The Sheriff’s Office encourages surveillance of locations where narcotics trafficking has
been severe, particularly where open-air transactions are conducted. Controlling trafficking
may mean making arrests for even minor misdemeanors committed in the officer's presence
(such as littering) in order to disperse possible criminal activities and to learn identities of
people.

F. Indicators  
The Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office expects Deputies to detect criminality by deploying all
legal investigative strategies, but Deputies are cautioned not to borrow a third-hand indicator
of a drug courier to substitute for good judgment. Reasonable suspicion that criminality has
occurred or is occurring depends on facts known to the Deputy at the time of the stop or
arrest. A legitimate indicator, sanctioned by the Department, is a very specific attribute that
is only valid for a limited time and under limited circumstances. These attributes or indicators
can only be established based on considerable training and experience about drug
trafficking. In any event, Deputies shall not consider race or national origin only in
determining whether or not to stop a person for a field interview.

G. Street strategies
The Department encourages all legal means of reducing drug trafficking. Deputies shall
remain mindful of the following strategies during patrol. The following street strategies shall
be used:

1. Use non-coercive conversations with possible suspects to create investigative

opportunities. Without a show of authority or application of force, no constitutional
issues arise that requires the use of Miranda rights or search warrants.

2. Employ consent searches where and when appropriate.  

3. Formulate reasonable suspicion, rely on observations of people and things that are

exposed to public view or are in public places. A reasonable suspicion that drug
trafficking has taken or is taking place may include flight or panic at the sight of a law
enforcement officer, lying while being questioned, or a display of extreme or unusual
nervousness in the presence of the officer. Use traffic stops to gather intelligence and
develop reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

4. Employ drug-sniffing dogs to establish probable cause.

5.

Inspect property abandoned by the suspect: no warrant requirements exist for this
kind of search. Also, search adjacent areas thoroughly near the suspect.  

Page  300

TCSO Policy and Procedures Manual
OPERATIONS
5-27 Narcotics Enforcement  
 

6. Deputies will engage in consensual conversation, photographing, or records checks
when appropriate, to identify unfamiliar persons.  Deputies will attempt to identify that
person by providing that person’s descriptive information to the Communications
Center. The information provided back from the Communications Center can then be
used to corroborate that person’s identity. Dealers from other jurisdictions thrive on
anonymity.

H. Disclosure of information obtained by authorized means
Deputies shall strictly adhere to the provisions of § 19.2-67 of the Code of Virginia. Deputies
shall not disclose information obtained by wire, electronic or oral communications outside of
authorized law-enforcement personnel.

I. Raid
Raid planning will include outlining procedures for warrant procurement, tactical team use,
deployment of personnel, officer safety, communications procedures, and collection of
evidence. Special planning must be done for raids involving suspected drug-producing
laboratories because of the dangers posed by hazardous chemicals. Raid planning may
include participation by other governmental agencies such as fire, social services, and
health authorities.

J.  Handling narcotics evidence

1. To the extent practicable, all drugs/narcotics shall be stored in clear plastic bags,
bottles, or other containers to allow the contraband to be visible, thus reducing the
need to break seals to examine or verify the evidence and thereby damage the chain
of custody. The original containers of drugs/narcotics (such as film containers,
prescription bottles) shall be packaged separately. Plant type material will be placed in
paper evidence containers to allow the package to breathe, which allows the plant
material to dry.

2. For recovered drugs, other than those in a tablet or capsule format, the recovering

officer will obtain a gross weight. The Deputy will document that gross weight in
his/her report, and the deputy will also document the street value of the narcotic.

a. Scales for weighing are provided at the Narcotics Enforcement Unit office and

the Sheriff’s Office Deputy’s Office. Before using the scales, officers shall check
to ensure that the scale reads a zero balance and is correctly set.

b. If the drug is a tablet or capsule, a count will be substituted for gross weight.  
c. Seized drugs should be field tested if possible before packaging.
d. The deputy will refer to the Street Value Chart for all drugs seized and will list

that value in the IBR. 

3. Deputies seizing drugs for prosecution shall fill out a Request for Laboratory

Examination and attach it to the evidence bags prior to the evidence being
relinquished to the evidence custodian.
