PURPOSE 
To establish policy and guidelines for electronic data collection resulting from the 
use of body worn audio/visual camcorders (BWC).  It also serves to direct officers 
and supervisors in the proper use and maintenance of the BWC.  The purpose of 
the BWC is to provide an accurate unbiased audio/visual record of enforcement 
related and non-criminal incidents that will enhance criminal prosecutions and 
limit civil liabilities. 
 
 
POLICY 
Officers of the Chincoteague Police Department shall use the issued BWC when 
interviewing suspects of crimes, field sobriety tests, traffic stops, establishing 
probable cause for pedestrian stops and detentions, or any situation, condition, or 
event having a potential for loss of life, injury, or damage to property.
