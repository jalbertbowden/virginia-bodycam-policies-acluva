SECTION: OPERATION 

          EFFECTIVE DATE: 3/1/2015 

           

 

 

 
I.       PURPOSE 

 
To establish policy regarding the use of Body Worn Recording Systems (BWRS) by 
members of the Halifax Police Department and to establish a policy regarding the 
storage, release and retention of BWRS audio/video (A/V) files maintained in department 
approved storage devices.  BWRS are intended to enhance the police services provided 
by the Halifax Police Department. 
 

II.         POLICY 
 

It is the policy of the Halifax Police Department that each law enforcement officer 
assigned to patrol shall begin his/her shift by placing the BWRS on the uniform and 
ensuring it is in proper working condition.  In the event, a BWRS fails the pre shift 
inspection the officer shall substitute said camera for one of the general use or back up 
units.   
 

III.        PROCEDURES 
 

A.  GENERAL USE 

             

1. 

Each patrol officer shall have a BWRS assigned specifically, by serial 
number, to him/her.  Excluding the use of the unassigned/backup BWRS 
officers shall not manipulate unassigned BWRS equipment.  All BWRS 
will be operated according to manufacturer’s recommendations and 
department regulations. 

2.         Only officers who have been issued and trained in the operation of a 

BWRS may operate/wear a device. 

3.         Officers shall use only department-issued body worn recording devices to 

record official department activities.  Duty-related recordings of any 
police department activity are the property of the police department.  The 
use of a privately owned BWRS is prohibited while on duty or within the 
police department, not generally accessible to the public or while in any 
department or town owned vehicle.  BWRS shall only be stored at police 
headquarters. 

4.         The BWRS will be worn on the strong hand shoulder or sunglasses.   

5.         In situations where a recording was made and a case report is required, the 
existence of the recording shall be documented in the report.  In situations 
where no case report is required, (excluding traffic stops) and the officer 
chooses to write an incident report, the existence of the recording shall be 
documented in the incident report. 

6.         If the BWRS is worn but not activated in a situation that is required by 

department policy, the officer will immediately report the circumstances to 
their supervisor at the conclusion of the related event, incident, or contact.  
The officer will also document the reason why the event was not recorded 
in a case report.   

B.  PRE-SHIFT INSPECTION 

1.         Each BWRS is individually assigned.  Officers are not permitted to wear a 

unit that has not been assigned to them unless the assigned BWRS 
malfunctions.  However, in no case shall an officer use a BWRS assigned 
to another officer without the approval of the chief or his/her designee.     

2.         Officers are required to check their BWRS for proper functioning prior to 

beginning their shift.  Should a malfunction or other problem with the 
system be identified, the officer shall report the issue to the chief in 
writing denoting the malfunction.   

3.         Officers are required to wear the BWRS during their entire tour of duty.  

Should a malfunction occur during their tour the officer shall return to 
police headquarters and deploy the unassigned/backup BWRS.  In 
addition, he/she shall notify the chief in writing denoting the malfunction.   

C.         RECORDING PROTOCOLS 

1.         Officers must activate their BWRS during the following situations unless 

doing so would be impractical or unsafe: 

a.         Traffic stops and accident investigations 
b.         Foot Pursuits 
c.         Response or Pursuit driving 
d.         Terry stops and pat downs 
e.         All vehicle and subject searches (including vehicle inventories)  
f.          All law-enforcement-related interactions where criminal activity is 

being actively investigated 

 

2.         Officers have discretion in whether or not to record informal, non-law 

enforcement-related interactions with members of the community. 

3.         Under normal circumstances, once a decision has been made to record an 
event, an officer may not stop the recording prior to the completion of the 
event/citizen encounter, unless directed to do so by a supervisor.  In rare 
cases, circumstances may dictate that an officer inhibit the video portion 
by shielding the lens for modesty/privacy concerns.    However, only if 
practical and only when safety permits. If officer safety does not permit 
such an action, the officer shall continue recording.   

4.         Officers may inform subjects that they are being recorded unless doing so 

would be unsafe or impractical.    

5.         Officers are NOT required, nor should they terminate a recorded 

interaction with a  suspect in a criminal investigation or investigatory 
detention. 

6.       If asked whether they are recording an event, officers are required to be 

truthful. 

7.       Officers ARE NOT permitted to record: 

a.         Other agency personnel during routine, non-law enforcement 

related activities 

b.         In restrooms or locker rooms, unless activation is required during 

the official performance of an officer’s duties 

c.         Discussions that involve pre-planned operational strategies or 

police tactics 

D.         TAGGING VIDEO RECORDINGS

devices.  Currently this is accomplished by the department’s contract with 
Evidence.com 

2.         Officers using a BWRS should review audio/video footage prior to writing 

case reports or providing courtroom testimony.  Unless detrimental to an 
investigation, officers should be provided an opportunity to review BWRS 
footage prior to giving a statement related to an administrative 
investigation or in response to other supervisory inquiries.   

3.         The chief may access and review audio/video file footage of officers as 

part of the department’s ongoing inspections and audits program.  BWRS 
reviews will be conducted to investigate complaints, for training purposes 
or to ensure compliance with department policy and recording protocols.  

4.         Access to file footage by department personnel for personal use and/or for 

uploading recorded data onto public and social media websites is strictly 
prohibited. 

5.         Access by officers and supervisory personnel will be limited to read-only 

files. 

6.         Officers requesting copies of video files for court purposes are to submit 
the request in writing denoting the reasons and the files to be accessed.   

7.         Release of audio/video data to external entities is strictly limited to law 

enforcement purposes only.  Subpoenas or Freedom of Information 
requests will be handled by the chief of police.   

G.         Training: 

1.         BWRS training is required for all agency personnel who may use or 

otherwise need a detailed knowledge of the BWRS.

receive mandated training which will include the following: 

a.         Related policies and recording protocols 

b.         Procedures for operating the equipment  

c.         Practical, scenario-based exercises that replicate situations that

f.          Procedures for preparing and presenting digital evidence for court
