BWCs 

require 

specific, 

As with many technological 
advances in policing, however, 
the deployment of this 
technology without proper 
safeguards and the right 
policies in place can turn a tool 
meant to promote police 
accountability into a tool that 
expands the surveillance state. 

Getting to Win-Win: Executive Summary 
 
Body  worn  cameras  (BWCs)  are  cameras  worn  on 
police officers’ bodies that record audio and video of 
officers’ 
interactions  with  the  public  from  the 
officers’  perspective.  Many  of  the  issues  of  data 
retention  and  access  associated  with  use  of  BWCs 
are  largely  the  same  as  with  dash  cameras,  aerial 
surveillance  video  collected  by  drones,  and  data 
from any other law enforcement deployed recording 
devices. 
special 
consideration, however, because they can be used to 
record  individuals  in  public  and  private  settings 
without  the  individual  or  the  public’s  knowledge.  Moreover,  their  ability  to  provide  the 
“officer’s eye view” of an interaction with a member or members of the public can make the 
data they acquire of particular interest to the public when either the conduct of police or 
community  members  is  in  question.  As  with  many  technological  advances  in  policing, 
however,  the  deployment  of  this  technology  without  proper  safeguards  and  the  right 
policies  in  place  can  turn  a  tool  meant  to  promote  police  accountability  into  a  tool  that 
expands the surveillance state.  
 
On  May  1,  2015,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  announced  the  establishment  of  a  $20 
million  Body-Worn  Cameras  Pilot  Partnership  Program.1  It  followed  the  rush  of 
departments seeking to obtain and deploy BWCs after the shooting death of Michael Brown 
in Ferguson, Missouri.2 Some touted BWCs as the solution to the problem of police violence 
in America.3 While deployment of BWCs will not end police violence, it has the potential to 
help  law  enforcement  departments  become  more  transparent,  accountable,  and  trusted, 
but if, and only if, the right policies are in place to guide deployment.  
 
Virginia has followed the post-Ferguson trend toward increased use of BWCs.4 Indeed, five 
Virginia  localities  (the  cities  of  Newport  News,  Waynesboro,  Lynchburg,  and  Fairfax  and 
Dinwiddie  County)  have  now  received  $500,000  in  grants  under  the  federal  partnership 
program. 
 
Given  the  public  interest  in  assuring  deployment  of  BWCs  serves  both  the  interests  of 
Virginians and the police who serve them, the ACLU of Virginia initiated a project to gather 
and report  to  the  public information  on the  use  of BWCs by law enforcement agencies in 
the  Commonwealth.  That  project  has  now  led  to  the  publication  of  this  report  and 
recommendations regarding the use of BWCs in Virginia.  
 
To  understand  the  use  of  BWCs  in  Virginia,  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  sent  a  Freedom  of 
Information  Act  (FOIA)  request  to  368  local  law  enforcement  agencies  to  collect  existing 
policies for review. We received and reviewed fifty-nine local policies in response to these 
requests.  For  more  information  on  the  methodology  used  to  gather  and  review  the  data, 
please see the Methodology section of this report below.

We  also  reviewed  the  Department  of  Criminal  Justice  Services’  “model”  BWC  Policy 
(developed  with  the  participation  of  law  enforcement  but  no  citizen  stakeholder 
input)(DCJS  BWC  Policy)  that  was  presented  in  draft  form  to  the  Law  Enforcement 
Technology subpanel of the Secure Commonwealth Panel at its meeting on September 15, 
2015. The DCJS BWC Policy is attached to this report as Appendix A. 
 

BWC implementation in 
Virginia is inconsistent at 
best, chaotic at worst. 
There are vast disparities 
from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction that make it 
difficult, if not impossible, 
for Virginians to know how 
BWCs are being used and 
what their rights are. 

The ACLU of Virginia has determined from the review of 
existing local policies and the “model” proposed by DCJS 
that  BWC  implementation  in  Virginia  is  inconsistent  at 
best,  chaotic  at  worst.  There  are  vast  disparities  from 
jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  that  make  it  difficult,  if  not 
impossible, for Virginians to know how BWCs are being 
used  and  what  their  rights  are.  Virginians  now  face  a 
bewildering array of policies governing the use of BWCs, 
as well as the retention and disclosure of the personally 
identifiable  data  acquired  through  their  use.  This 
situation  is  further  complicated  by  an  advisory  opinion 
issued  by  the  Virginia  Freedom  of  Information  Act 
Advisory Council on October 2, 2015. The advisory opinion concludes that  FOIA imposes 
different disclosure rules on local police and Sheriffs than apply to other law enforcement 
agencies,  and  it    includes  no  discussion  of  the  possible  interplay  between  FOIA  and  the 
Government  Data  Collection  and  Dissemination  Practices  Act  with  regard  to  law 
enforcement collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information.5  
 
Key  gaps  between  policy  and  principle  identified  in  our  review  that  threaten  individual 
liberty include: 

  Only 3% of BWC policies now in place require officers to inform the public that 
they  are  being  recorded.  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  only  requires  officers  to  inform 
the public where “practical.” 

  Only 5% of BWC policies now in place require officers to allow a victim of crime 
to decline to be filmed. The DCJS BWC Policy does not require officers to allow a 
victim to decline to be filmed. 

  Only  3%  of  BWC  policies  now  in  place  prohibit  the  use  of  BWC  to  record  First 
Amendment protected activities such as peaceful protests. The DCJS BWC Policy 
does not prohibit filming First Amendment-protected activities. 

  Only  5%  of  BWC  policies  now  in  place  address  BWC  usage  on  school  grounds. 

The DCJS BWC Policy does not address usage of BWCs on school grounds. 

  Only  12%  of  BWC  polices  now  in  place  prohibit  the  use  of  BWCs  in  a  private 
residence if the resident objects. The DCJS BWC Policy does not prohibit use of 
BWCs in a private residence if the resident objects. 

 
To address these gaps and bring uniformity to the implementation of BWCs across Virginia, 
this report sets out arguments in favor of statewide uniformity and recommended policies 
in four key areas. These include: 

 

3 

  Rules  governing  when 

law  enforcement  officers  are  recording  civilian 

encounters and what notice requirements govern their deployment; 

  Rules governing how long data is stored; 
  Rules  and  laws  governing  individual  and  public  access  to  data  collected  by 

BWCs; and 

  Rules  governing  consequences  of  failure  to  comply  with  provisions  of  policies 
assuring transparency and accountability in the use of BWCs, including possible 
decertification as a law enforcement officer. 

 
Proponents of BWCs argue that they can serve as a tool to 
increase  law  enforcement  transparency,  accountability, 
and trust. The ACLU of Virginia believes that the decision 
whether to acquire and deploy BWCs should be made by 
law  enforcement  agencies  with 
local  and  state 
appropriate 
the 
communities  they  serve.  At  the  same  time,  however,  the 
ACLU  of  Virginia  believes  strongly  that  deployment  of 
BWCs can serve the interests of police and the public only 
if proper policies are in place to guide their use. The ACLU of Virginia has advocated before 
the Fairfax County Ad Hoc Police Review Commission and the Law Enforcement Subpanel 
of  the  Secure  Commonwealth  Panel  that  the  following  principles  guide  law  enforcement 
use of BWCs:

and 

from 

  Policies  must  prohibit  use  of  body-worn  cameras  to  gather  information  about 
people surreptitiously. They should not be turned on at public events to surveil 
those in attendance. 
 

  Only officers with arrest authority should be authorized to use BWCs.  

 

  Officers must be required to notify people when the cameras are on and they are 

being recorded.  
 

  Policies should protect the privacy of officers by making clear that cameras are 

only required to be turned on during defined interactions with the public. 
 

  Policies  should  be  explicit  about  when  cameras  are  to  be  turned  on  and  when 
and whether they can be turned off. Officers should have no discretion to deviate 
from departmental policy. 
 

  Policies  should  require  that  every  officer  wearing  cameras  turn  the  recording 
device on at the inception of every law enforcement encounter with a member of 
the  public,  including  stops,  frisks,  searches,  arrests,  consensual  searches  and 
interviews,  enforcement  actions  and  any  encounter 
that  becomes 
confrontational or in any way hostile.

  People  who  are  being  filmed  should  have  the  right  to  request  that  BWCs  be 
turned off when the officer is entering their home or business, hospital room or 
other private location or when they are seeking to make an anonymous report of 
a  crime  or  claim  to  be  a  victim  of  crime.  Their  request  should  be  filmed.  In 
addition,  policies  should  include  specific  guidelines  for  recording  juveniles  and 
in schools.  
 

  Strict policies should guide how the recorded information is uploaded from the 

individual camera and stored so that videos cannot be manipulated or erased. 
 

 

  Data  should  be  retained  only  as  long  as  necessary  for  intended  purposes.  It 
should  be  maintained  and  destroyed  pursuant  to  applicable  law  and  record 
retention policies and never by the officer involved in the recording.  
 

  Videos of specific value  should be  “flagged” and retained for as  long  as  needed 
for  personnel  actions  or  criminal  investigations.  Those  with  no  ascertainable 
value should be deleted in accordance with a published schedule except on the 
request  of  a  data  subject.  Flagging  should  occur  automatically  for  incidents 
involving  the  use  of  force,  leading  to  detention,  summons,  or  arrest,  and/or 
resulting in a citizen complaint. 
 

  Policies should provide access to the videos by the people recorded for as long as 
the  videos  are  maintained  by  the  government/law  enforcement.  Properly 
redacted footage should be made available to the public in accordance with well-
defined guidelines, where the public interest would be served by disclosure.  
 

  Failure  to  comply  with  the  policies  governing  use  of  the  cameras  and  videos 

should result in appropriate disciplinary action, including termination. 

As a whole, the 59 local agency 
BWC policies and the DCJS 
BWC Policy that the ACLU of 
Virginia analyzed fail to ensure 
that BWCs are deployed in a 
way that promotes 
transparency, accountability, 
and trust. 

 
Adherence  to  these  principles  is  essential  to  ensure 
that  deployment  of  body  worn  cameras  by  state  or 
local police agencies is truly a win-win for the police 
and the public alike. Unfortunately, our review found 
that  neither  the  local  policies  now  in  place  nor  the 
DCJS BWC Policy comply fully with these principles. 
In addition, in some instances, current FOIA law may 
stand  in  the  way  of  adopting  local  policies  that 
comply with these principles in some instances. 
 

While some individual policies do a better job in addressing some or all of these principles 
than others, as a whole, the 59 local agency BWC policies and the DCJS BWC Policy that the 
ACLU  of  Virginia  analyzed  fail  to  ensure  that  BWCs  are  deployed  in  a  way  that  promotes 
transparency,  accountability,  and  trust.  The  policies  often  do  not  articulate  clearly  what 
actions and events should be filmed, and they miss the mark when it comes to protecting 
the  privacy  of  individuals  in  sensitive  situations.  They  do  not  properly  safeguard  footage 

 

5 

from inappropriate sharing.  They fail to provide ordinary citizens the access to  their own 
data to which they are entitled. Finally, they lack mechanisms to hold officers accountable 
for intentionally or unintentionally violating policy.  
 
To  help  solve  these  problems,  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  developed  its  own  Model  Body  Worn 
Camera Policy that includes the elements we believe are essential to getting to “win-win,” 
that  is,  ensuring  that  use  of  BWCs  serves  the  interest  of  both  law  enforcement  and  the 
public protecting liberty and privacy as  well as assuring accountability and transparency. 
The  ACLU  Model  Policy  is  attached  as  Appendix  B.  We  recognize  that  implementing  our 
Model  policy  and  getting  to  win-win  may  require  changes  in  FOIA  and  the  Government 
Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act and adoption of laws requiring statewide 
uniformity  on  certain  policy  elements  to  best  protect  individual  privacy  and  the  public’s 
right to know. Nonetheless, we believe that Virginia can only get to “win-win” in the use of 
BWCs if these changes are made and uniform policies adopted statewide. 
 
 
Getting to Win-Win: The Cultural and Legal Context 
 
The power of law enforcement is awesome – it has the authority to deprive individuals of 
their  life  and  liberty.  Particularly  because  of  this  level  of  power,  law  enforcement 
departments  should  deploy  tools  that  enhance  transparency,  accountability,  and  public 
trust.  Body  worn  cameras  (BWCs),  if  properly  deployed,  can  help  law  enforcement 
departments further these aims.    
 
Reasons to Deploy Body-Worn Cameras 
Deployment of BWCs can: 

  Affect  the  conduct  of  both  community  members  and  law  enforcement  in  a 
positive way, resulting in greater officer safety, the reduction of the use of force 
by  law  enforcement,  and  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  complaints  by 
individuals about law enforcement conduct.6 

 
  Provide  communities  an  additional  measure  of  transparency  about  the  way  in 

which they are policed. 

 
  Promote  law  enforcement  accountability  by  providing  a  real  time  video  and 

audio record of police/community interactions. 

 
  Help  protect  law  enforcement  officers  by  providing  objective  evidence  to  be 

used in resolving complaints and in disciplining officers. 

 
BWCs can be an important tool in efforts to develop, protect, and, where necessary, restore 
trust between law enforcement and the communities that they serve. Their successful use 
is  dependent,  however,  on  the  existence  and  implementation  of  policies  that  achieve  the 
goals  outlined  by  the  Police  Executive  Research  Forum  (PERF)  –  fostering  transparency 

 

6 

and  accountability  and  protecting  civil  liberties  and  privacy  interests.  BWCs  deployed 
without policies designed to achieve these goals will undercut rather than build trust. 
 
The ACLU of Virginia believes that deployment of BWCs can be a “win” for both the public 
and police for two reasons. First, the power of law enforcement coupled with a history of 
abuse  by  some  officers  can  justify  the  use  of  BWCs,  even  when  balancing  the  potential 
negative  impact  on  residents’  privacy.  Historically,  there  was  no  real-time  documentary 
evidence  of  most  encounters  between  law  enforcement  and  the  public.  Due  to  the 
sometimes-volatile  nature  of  those  encounters,  this  often  resulted  in  radically  divergent 
accounts of incidents. BWCs have the potential to be a neutral arbiter and serve as a check 
on law enforcement’s power.  
 
Second, while it is too early to tell the true impact of BWCs on police-community relations, 
some  early  empirical  studies  document  a  positive  trend.7  For  example,  a  study  on  the 
impact of police and community relations in Rialto, California found that law enforcement 
use of force fell by 60% during the initial 12-month period of BWC use.8 In addition, public 
complaints  against  law  enforcement  decreased  by  88%  during  that  period.9  Researchers 
studying the impact of BWCs in Rialto also found that the likelihood of a law enforcement 
officer using force was roughly twice as high if the officer was not wearing a BWC.10   
 
Nonetheless,  as  discussed  in  detail  below,  the  positive  impact  of  BWCs  can  only  occur  if 
policies  are  in  place  that  protect  the  interests  of  both  police  and  the  public.  In  addition, 
while  studies  suggest  the  potential  positive  impact  regarding  police  and  community 
relations, the deployment of BWCs should not be viewed as an end in and of itself, but as a 
tool in achieving transparency and accountability.  
 
BWCs have  the  potential to increase accountability, but will not  solve  the  problem of law 
enforcement  abuse  or  the  community’s  subsequent  loss  of  trust  in  law  enforcement.. 
Moreover, as was learned after the videotaped death of Eric Garner in New York City, the 
existence of cameras does not guarantee positive outcomes.11   
 
The  solution  to  these  important  problems  requires  a  structural  shift  in  the  culture  and 
mindset of law enforcement and the reassertion of civilian authority over the policies that 
guide  policing  at  all  levels.  At  the  foundation  of  this  shift  are  the  concepts  and  values  of 
constitutional policing and respect for the value of human life  -- concepts and values that 
should be inherent in all law enforcement personnel.  
 
Establishing the Community Culture Needed to Support Effective Use of BWCs 
Police,  community  members,  and  taxpayers  must  recognize  that  BWCs  are  only  a  tool. 
Localities should make the choice whether to deploy them using a process that assures the 
full engagement of community members in the development of the policies that guide their 
use. 
 
Virginians must recognize that the deployment of body cameras cannot and will not solve 
problems such as racial profiling, excessive use of force, or other police abuses. Virginians 
must  recognize  that  law  enforcement  cannot  solve  community  problems  arising  from

care 

and 

drug 

and 

health 

education, 

treatment, 

poverty, drug use, and other social ills. Society cannot arrest its way out of a public health 
problem or school discipline issue.  
 
To  address  these  larger  community  problems,  there  must  be  a  holistic  approach  that 
incorporates 
economic 
development.12Communities,  and  the  elected  leaders  who  serve  them,  must  commit  to 
funding  public  safety  as  a  priority  recognizing  that  underpaid  and  undervalued  police 
compromise  our  safety.  Public  safety  should  be  seen  as  a  core  function  and  fundamental 
expense  of  government,  not  a  revenue  stream.  Police  departments  and  the  state  or  local 
jurisdictions  they  serve  should  not  create,  facilitate,  or  allow  the  development  of  a 
dependence  on  financial  returns  from  policing  (asset  forfeiture,  “million  dollar  mile,”  red 
light  cameras  vs.  extended  yellow,  success  measured  by  increased  arrests,  tickets, 
summonses vs. increase safety outcomes).13  
 
If  a  locality  or  the  Commonwealth  decides  to  purchase  and  deploy  BWCs  on  its  law 
enforcement personnel, it should do so only if it is committed to funding the program from 
its general funds and in its base budget. 
 
Establishing the Law Enforcement Culture Needed to Support Effective Use of BWCs 
In order for BWCs to be an effective tool of accountability and transparency, the culture in 
the law enforcement agency that deploys them must support both. 
 
There must be a culture of service in the agency. Law enforcement personnel (whether in 
the  local  police  department,  sheriff’s  office,  or  State  Police)  must  reflect  the  communities 
they serve.14 They must also see the people in the community not as the “policed” but as the 
public they serve. 
 
There must be a culture of transparency at all levels in every law enforcement agency. The 
“default” value in the agency must support openness rather than secrecy. The leadership of 
the law enforcement agency and all levels of government should take seriously the policy 
embraced  in  the  Virginia  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  §2.2-3700,  that  the  Act  “shall  be 
liberally  construed  to  promote  an  increased  awareness  by  all  persons  of  governmental 
activities  and  afford  every  opportunity  to  citizens  to  witness  the  operations  of 
government.” Information should be disclosed, rather than withheld, whenever possible. 
 
In addition, law enforcement officials should take seriously the Act’s direction that it should 
not be “construed to discourage the free discussion by government officials or employees 
of public matters with the citizens of the Commonwealth.” There should be a willingness to 
engage  the  public  in  setting  law  enforcement  agency  policies  on  “use  of  force”  and  other 
policies directly affecting the people being served.15 
 
There  must  be  a  culture  of  accountability.  The  peoples’  authority  should  be  paramount. 
There  should  be  a  willingness  to  collect  and  report  data  that  permits  evaluation  of 
departmental  practices  as  has  been  done  voluntarily  by  the  Charlottesville  Police 
Department.16  There  must  be  openness  to  independent  evaluation  of  outcomes  good  and 
bad. 

 

8 

 
Finally,  there  must  be  a  culture  of  constitutionality.  Police  must  see  themselves  as  the 
guardians  of  the  Constitution.  Constitutional  policing  should  be  the  paramount  value  in 
hiring,  evaluation,  training,  policies  and  procedures,  including  policies  on  “consent 
searches,” pretextual stops, and use of body-worn cameras and other technologies. A body-
worn camera can be a tool that supports constitutional policing  if and only if the proper 
policies and training are in place before cameras are deployed. 17 
 
 
Getting to Win-Win: The Need for Statewide Uniformity 
 
Virginians who wish to understand the policies governing the use of BWCs should not be 
expected to memorize dozens of different policies. Virginians should not need to  seek out 
and understand various, complicated flagging and retention formulas that vary drastically 
from one  jurisdiction  to the  next  to  understand how government agencies  maintain their 
personal  information.  Virginians  should  not  “experience”  the  use  of  BWCs  differently  on 
one side of a local law enforcement “border” than another. The ACLU of Virginia’s review of 
the existing BWC policies shows, however, that is exactly what Virginians face today.   
 
In  addition,  law  enforcement  officers  should  be  subject  to  equal  expectations  and  equal 
discipline  across 
jurisdictions,  and  there  must  be  uniform  consequences  across 
jurisdictions for the misuse of the cameras or the data that they collect. 
 
Recommendation  No.  1  –  The  General  Assembly  must  enact  legislation  that  assures 
policies  governing  BWCs  are  uniform  across  the  Commonwealth  in  each  of  four  key 
areas: when and how they are activated by  officers; how long the  data they collect is 
kept; who has access to the data collected; and consequences of failure to comply with 
law or policy regarding their use. 
 
Virginians  and  the  law  enforcement  personnel  who  serve  them  have  a  right  to  expect 
uniformity  of  BWC  policy,  regardless  of  jurisdiction  with  respect  to  at  least  the  following 
issues: 
 

  Rules  governing  when 

law  enforcement  officers  are  recording  civilian 

encounters and what notice requirements govern their deployment. 
 

  Rules governing what data is stored and for how long. 

 

 

  Rules and laws governing public access to data collected by BWCs. 

  Rules governing consequences of failure to comply with BWC policies. 

 
The lack of uniformity in the 59 local policies reviewed by the ACLU of Virginia makes clear 
that Virginia needs to establish certain minimum mandatory criteria for policies governing 
the use of BWCs by law enforcement agencies choosing to deploy them.  

 

9 

 
In  addition,  the  General  Assembly  should  address  apparent  conflicts  between  the 
protections offered data subjects under the Government Data Collection and Dissemination 
Practices  Act,  and  the  retention  and  disclosure  requirements  included  in  other  laws 
governing  public  records  (FOIA  and  the  state  record  retention  laws  and  policies).  For 
example,  Section  2.2-3805  gives  data  subjects  the  right  to  review  personally  identifiable 
information  held by government agencies, and the  limitations of this right  relative  to law 
enforcement records are unclear.18  
 
Recommendation  No.  2  –  The  General  Assembly  must  enact  legislation  assuring 
Virginians that violations of state laws and departmental policies governing the use of 
BWCs do not result in harm to individuals.  
 
BWCs should not be a tool to engage in unchecked surveillance. To minimize the incentive 
for  engaging  in  mass  surveillance,  the  General  Assembly  should  enact  legislation  that 
provides  that  any  data collected  or  stored  in  contravention  of  state  law  or  in  violation  of 
departmental  policy  governing  the  use  of  BWCs  (or  any  other  surveillance  technology) 
should be immediately destroyed and should not be admissible in any criminal or civil case. 
 
Coupled with the need for effective discipline is the need to ensure that individuals are not 
harmed  if  a  law  enforcement  officer’s  fails  to  follow  department  policy.  For  example, 
criminal  defendants  should  have  a  rebuttable  evidentiary  presumption  when  they  assert 
that exculpatory evidence was destroyed or not captured. In addition, individuals suing the 
government  should  have  a  rebuttable  evidentiary  presumption  when  they  reasonably 
assert that evidence supporting their claim was destroyed or not captured.   
 
In  addition, the  General Assembly should consider whether an officer disciplined or fired 
for failing to  comply  with departmental policies  on the  use of technology that gather and 
record  personally  identifiable  information,  including  body  cameras,  should  be  subject  to 
decertification  as  a  law enforcement officer pursuant to Section  15.2-1707 of  the  Code  of 
Virginia.  Virginians  should  not  be  in  a  position  where  a  noncompliant  officer  is  simply 
moved  from  department  to  department  because  they  continue  to  be  certified  by  the 
Commonwealth pursuant to Section 15.2-1706 of the Code of Virginia. 
 
Recommendation  No.  3  –  The  General  Assembly  must  enact  legislation  ensuring  that 
personally identifiable data collected by BWCs is not disseminated to third parties for 
non-law enforcement purposes without the subject’s consent, except where such public 
disclosure is determined in writing to be in the public interest. 
 
The  purpose  of  policies  governing  the  use  of  BWCs  is  to  create  more  transparent, 
accountable, and trusted law enforcement agencies without infringing unnecessarily on the 
right of privacy or liberty of Virginians. Data collected by BWCs should not be exploited by 
law enforcement agencies or third parties for commercial uses. In addition to undermining 
the purpose of the BWCs, personal information cannot be collected, stored, or disseminated 
under  the  Data  Act  unless  the  government’s  need  for  such  collection  has  been  clearly 

 

10 

established in advance and the information is appropriate and relevant for the purpose for 
which it was collected.19  
 
Law  enforcement  agencies  that  contract  with  third-parties  to  maintain  the  data  should 
ensure safeguards are in place to protect the data from unauthorized disclosure.  
 
In addition, the General Assembly should enact legislation assuring data subjects the right 
to review any BWC collected data personally identifiable to them and prohibit third-parties 
from independently accessing, viewing, or altering the data unless they are acting as agents 
of  a  law  enforcement  agency  with  which  the  agency  has  contracted  for  data  storage  and 
maintenance.  
 
Current  law  (FOIA  and  the  Government  Data  Collection  and  Dissemination  Practices  Act) 
should be amended as needed to ensure that personally identifiable information about data 
subjects  is  not  released  without  their  consent  unless  the  head  of  the  law  enforcement 
agency  in  custody  of  the  data  has  determined  in  writing  that  disclosure  is  in  the  public 
interest and is necessary to assure transparency and accountability for the actions of law 
enforcement or the data subjects involved.  
 
 
Getting to Win-Win: Changes Needed in Local Policies and State Model 
 
Protecting the Liberty, Rights, and Privacy of Individual Virginians 
As  the  ACLU  of  Virginia’s  analysis  documents,  with  limited  exceptions,  current  BWC 
policies leave the privacy and First Amendment rights of Virginians in jeopardy. 
 
Recommendation No. 4 – BWC policies must require police to inform people that they 
are being filmed. 
 
Discussion: 
BWCs  have  the  potential  to  record  interactions  and  locations  that  members  of  the  public 
may wish to remain private. Thus, it is important that BWC policies include clear notice and 
privacy  protections.  To  protect  the  privacy  of  members  of  the  public,  the  deployment  of 
BWCs should be  limited to uniformed law enforcement officers and those  non-uniformed 
officers involved in SWAT actions or other planned use of force and enforcement actions. 
This  recommendation  closely  mirrors  a  recommendation  made  by  the  Police  Executive 
Research Forum, which justified the importance of notice by pointing out that “[t]he mere 
knowledge  that  one  is  being  recorded  can  help  promote  civility  during  police-citizen 
encounters.”20    
 
Law enforcement officers should be required to notify the subject(s) of the recording that 
they  are  being  recorded  by  the  BWC.  This  notification  should  be  made  as  soon  as 
reasonably  possible  following  initiation  of  the  encounter.  The  only  exception  to  this 
mandate  should  be  instances  involving  law  enforcement  pursuits  or  other  exigent 

 

11 

circumstances  where  the  officer  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  provide  immediate 
notice. In those cases, the officer should provide notice at the first reasonable opportunity.   
 
Law-abiding  Virginians  should  not  fear  that  their  government  is  recording  their  personal 
conversations or their engagement in First Amendment-protected activities. Yet, the ACLU 
of  Virginia’s  analysis  of  both  the  DCJS  BWC  Policy  and  the  local  BWC  policies  shows  that 
this fear has merit in many parts of the Commonwealth. 
 
This is all the more important because current FOIA interpretations regarding disclosure of 
personally identifiable data appear to compromise personal privacy without benefit to the 
public’s right to know. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key Finding: The DCJS BWC Policy requires officers to provide notice of 
the use of BWCs only when “practical.”  
Section  III.E.1  provides  that  officers  “shall  inform  individuals  that  they  are 
being recorded” “whenever practical.” There is no definition of “practical” in 
the policy. 

 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Most  BWC  policies  permit  law  enforcement  officers  to 
record individuals without notification. 
Only  two  of  the  59  departments  that  have  deployed  BWCs  require  their 
officers  to  inform  the  public  that  they  are  being  recorded21  and  one 
department requires notice only if asked.22 Of the remaining 56 departments, 
three  encourage  officers  to  provide  notice,23  four  only  provide  notice 
protection  to  other  members  of  the  department,24  and  four  grant  officers 
complete  discretion.25 The  policies  that grant  officers discretion  range from 
suggesting notice is a good idea26 to suggesting notice only be provided if it 
would assist the officer.27 In addition to the general failure of departments to 
provide  notice,  only  two  departments  explicitly  state  their  officers  must  be 
truthful if asked  whether an individual is  being recorded, which makes  one 
wonder about those policies that don’t make this requirement to be truthful 
explicit.28  

Virginians deserve to know when BWCs are actively recording them. The rule 
should  be  that  notice  is  given  unless  exigent  circumstances  prevent  the 
officer  from  doing  so,  and,  even  then,  notice  should  be  given  as  soon  as 
possible. 

 
Recommendation No. 5 – BWC policies must require police to inform people that they 
may ask not to be filmed when police enter the privacy of their home (or other location 
where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy) without a warrant or when they 
are  crime  victims,  witnesses  who  are  seeking  to  provide  information  to  police 
confidentially, or they are confidential informants. 

 

12 

 
Discussion: 
The  importance  of  protecting  the  privacy  of  Virginians  should  lead  all  law  enforcement 
departments to mandate that people have a right to tell law enforcement to turn cameras 
off in their homes and other private spaces, and that the police inform them of that right. 
Notice of the right not to be filmed should be given immediately upon entering a home or 
other  location  where  the  people  have  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy.  Law 
enforcement  officers  should  seek  permission  from  the  resident(s)  to  record  inside  the 
house or private location, and, if the permission is denied, the officer(s) must abide by the 
individual’s request and cease recording.  The  request to record inside the house or other 
private location and any denial should be recorded on the BWC.  
 
The  only  exception  to  the  requirement  to  turn  BWCs  off  in  private  spaces  upon  request 
should be when entry is authorized by a search warrant or exigent circumstances justifying 
a  warrantless  search,  or  when  after  notice  of  both  the  right  to  refuse  a  search  and  to 
prohibit recording, the individual consents to the search and the recording. 
 
BWC  policies  should  must  protect  the  privacy  of  crime  victims  and  persons  seeking  to 
report a crime or assist in a law enforcement investigation anonymously. Law enforcement 
officers with BWCs should be required to ask a crime victim or person seeking to remain 
anonymous, as soon as practicable, if they wish to have the BWC deactivated. If the answer 
is  yes,  then  the  law  enforcement  officer  should  immediately  deactivate  the  BWC.  The 
request to deactivate the camera should be recorded by the BWC.  
 
This is even more important given the limited ability of data subjects to control disclosure 
of personally identifiable information once acquired under current interpretations of FOIA 
by the FOIA Council. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  does  not  require  the  police  to 
provide notice to an individual of the right to decline to allow recording 
nor are the exceptions to the right to decline recording properly limited 
to  entry  to  a  private  premises  with  a  warrant  or  in  exigent 
circumstances. 
The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  provides  that  “in  locations  where  individuals  have  a 
reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  such  as  a  residence,  individuals  may 
decline  to  be  recorded  unless  the  recording  is  being  made  pursuant  to  an 
investigation,  arrest,  or  search  of  a  residence  or  individuals  within  the 
residence.”  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  also  states  that  BWC  generally  should  not 
be  used  to  record  “encounters”  with  undercover  police  or  confidential 
informants or when “community members” “reporting a crime.” Section III. E.

when  the  police  are  filming  while  serving  a  warrant  or  they  have  obtained 
voluntary  consent  to  search  after  full  notice  of  the  right  to  refuse  both  the 
search without a warrant and the filming. 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  With  limited  exceptions,  local  policies  now  in  place  give 
individuals  in  private  homes,  witnesses  and  confidential  informants 
little control over whether they are recorded.  
As  noted  above,  only  two  of  59  departments  require  law  enforcement  to 
provide notice of the use of a BWC.29 Only six of 59 departments prohibit the 
use  of  BWCs  in  a  private  residence  if  the  resident  objects.30  Nevertheless, 
while residents in these six jurisdictions have the right to request the BWCs 
be  turned off,  none of the  policies  include  a  mandatory notice requirement. 
Accordingly,  residents  may  not  know  that  the  BWC  is  deployed  in  the  first 
place, and, therefore, may not know there is a need to exercise this right.   

In  almost  every  jurisdiction  where  police  have  deployed  BWCs,  the  officers 
retain  control  over  whether  to  record  crime  victims,  witnesses,  and 
confidential informants. Only three of the 59 jurisdictions permit a victim to 
decline to be filmed.31 Of those three, only Norfolk Police Department places 
a positive obligation on its officers to inform individuals that they are being 
recorded. Thus, victims in the other two jurisdictions may not know that they 
may exercise this right. Of the three that permit the victim to control whether 
they  are  filmed,  only  Norfolk  and  Orange  Police  Departments  mandate  that 
the victim’s decision be documented on film.32 Of the remaining jurisdictions, 
Virginia  Commonwealth  University  (VCU)  Police  Department  prohibits  the 
recording  of  victim  statements  regarding  crimes  of  a  sexual  nature,  unless 
directed  by  a  supervisor.33  Tazewell  County  Sheriff's  Office  deputies  must 
record victims unless instructed otherwise by a supervisor, and Massanutten 
Police  Department  officers  must  record  victims  unless  there  is  a  legal 
exception.34  Finally,  though  the  Gordonsville  Police  Department  does  not 
have  a  policy  specific  to  filming  victims,  it  does  encourage  its  officers  to 
activate BWCs when responding to domestic situations, many of which may 
include interactions with a victim.35  

Only  two  of  59  jurisdictions  permit  anonymous  witnesses  to  decline  to  be 
recorded.36  Of  those  two,  only  Norfolk  mandates  notice  of  BWC  use  and 
requires that the informant’s decision be documented on video.37 Conversely, 
Patrick  County  Sheriff's  Office  suggests  that  its  deputies  record  such 
interactions and Tazewell County Sheriff's Office mandates recording unless 
instructed  otherwise  by  a  supervisor.  Finally,  Ferrum  College  Police 
Department  is  the  only  jurisdiction  that  permits  confidential  informants  to 
decline to be recorded.38 Nine departments intentionally restrict the filming 
of confidential informants.39

Recommendation  No.  6  –  BWC  policies  must  prohibit  the  use  of  BWCs  for  mass  video 
and  audio  surveillance  and  when  people  are  engaging  in  activities  protected  by  the 
First Amendment. 
 
Discussion: 
Law-abiding  residents  should  not  fear  that  their  government 
is  recording  First 
Amendment-protected  activities,  such  as  political  protests  or  faith  services.  If  misused, 
BWCs  can  put  this  right  in  jeopardy.  For  example,  while  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  said 
private  membership  organizations  cannot  be  compelled  to  turn  over  their  membership 
lists to the  government,40  yet BWCs give law enforcement  the  ability  to make  an end run 
around  this  protection.  All  an  officer  would  need  to  do  is  attend  a  NAACP  or  Tea  Party 
meeting,  download  the  data,  and  utilize  facial  recognition  software.  Not  only  would  this 
provide the government with a list of people attending political or social events, but would 
also, if an officer attended each meeting, provide the  government with a good idea  of the 
leadership  structure  and  who  the  more  active  members  are.  Therefore,  BWC  policies 
should  prohibit  the  use  of  BWCs  to  gather  intelligence  information  during  First 
Amendment-protected  activities  if  the  activity  is  unrelated  to  a  call  for  service  or  other 
interaction between a law enforcement officer and member of the public in a public space.  
 
The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  and  local  policies  should  prohibit  use  of  BWCs  to  conduct  general 
surveillance at public gatherings. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key Finding: The DCJS BWC Policy contains no limits on the use of BWCs 
to  conduct  general  surveillance  or  to  record  members  of  the  public 
engaged in First Amendment activities. 

 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  The  vast  majority  of  law  enforcement  departments  with 
active BWC use fail to prohibit their officers from encroaching on First 
Amendment rights.  
Only  two  departments,  Manassas  Park  City  Police  Department41  and 
Woodstock  Police  Department,42  provide  explicit  prohibitions  in  their 
policies  against  the  use  of  BWCs  to  record  First  Amendment-protected 
activities. The remaining 57 departments fail to include language relevant to 
protecting  this  right,  with  the  exception  of  the  Norfolk  Police  Department, 

15 

which  provides  no  specific  prohibition,  but  states  that  officers  should  not 
wear cameras at closed-door public or private meetings.43  

 
Recommendation No. 7 – BWC policies (or state law) must provide that individuals who 
are filmed have a right to view any video on which they appear as long as the video is 
maintained by the law enforcement agency or its agents. 
 
Discussion: 
Individuals recorded by BWCs should have access to the data for so long as it is maintained 
by a public agency. The Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act says 
that  data  subjects  should  have  the  right  to  inspect  records  that  contain  personally 
identifiable information. Defendants in criminal investigations should be given a copy as a 
part of criminal discovery and department employees subject to adverse personnel actions 
based in whole or in part of such videos should also be provided with copies at the outset of 
any administrative process.  
 
Where  copies  of  such  videos  would  reveal  the  identities  of  other  private  individuals, 
Virginia law should be amended if necessary to assure that the public agency providing the 
copies  redacts  such  personally  identifiable  information  before  providing  the  video  where 
appropriate  under  the  circumstances.  Individuals  who  are  the  subjects  of  BWC  videos 
should have the authority to permit the disclosure of the data to their attorneys and to any 
other third party so long as the identities of any other private individuals are protected by 
video redaction. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  contains  no  provision  regarding 
access to video by data subjects. 

 

Local Policies 

local  policies 

include  no  provisions 

Key  Finding:  Generally, 
guaranteeing data subjects access to video in which they appear. 
Only  two  departments  address  the  issue  of  ensuring  that  data  is  generally 
made  available  to  the  parties  involved.  Martinsville  Police  department’s 
policy  states  that  “[a]ny  citizen  who  is  recorded  on  one  of  the  videos  is 
welcome  to  view  the  video.”44  Aquia  Harbour  Police  Department’s  written 
response  to  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  FOIA  stated  that  data  is  generally  made 
available to the parties involved and all data is made public on a case by case 
basis, though its actual policy does not address this issue.45 The remaining 57 
departments  fail  to  include  specific  language  ensuring  that  individuals 
recorded by BWCs can access the data.  

 
Recommendation  No.  8  –  BWC  policies  should  recognize  the  heightened  privacy 
interests  of  children  compelled  to  attend  school  and  restrict  use  of  BWCs  on  primary 
and secondary school grounds.  BWCs should be activated only when law enforcement 
is engaged in the physical restraint or other use of force against a student. 

 

16 

 
Discussion: 
Law  enforcement  officers  acting  in  their  official  capacity  should  not  be  present  on 
elementary or secondary school grounds unless responding to a real and imminent threat 
of harm to individuals on school property. Virginia public schools should focus their finite 
resources on evidence-based solutions to school discipline issues, and not on increasing the 
number or role of school safety and school resource officers. As the University of Virginia 
Curry School of Education  found, Virginia “[s]chools are not  dangerous places.  . . . In  fact, 
very few violent crimes take place at school. From the standpoint of violent crime, students 
are safer at school than at home. Moreover, schools have become even safer during the past 
decade . . . .”[i] Therefore, unless a situation presents a real and imminent harm to students, 
parents,  or  school  faculty  or  staff,  students  should  not  come  into  contact  with  law 
enforcement officers who have the power to interrogate, arrest, and use force against them.   
 
Unfortunately, in many school divisions across the Commonwealth students will come into 
contact  with  law  enforcement  on  much  more  regular  basis,  either  through  the 
establishment  of  a  school  resource  officer  (SRO)  program  or  the  use  of  local  law 
enforcement  to  police  student  misbehavior.  While  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  opposes  this 
overreliance of law enforcement in Virginia’s primary and secondary schools, BWC policies 
should  ensure  that  any  officer  assigned  a  BWC  and  deployed  to  a  primary  or  secondary 
school  must  activate  their  BWC  for  each  encounter  with  a  student  that  involves  physical 
restraint  or  other  use  of  force  upon  a  student.  If  the  restraint  or  use  of  force  is  not 
reasonably anticipated, the videotaping should begin as soon as reasonably possible after it 
begins.  
 
BWC  policies  should  prohibit  the  use  of  BWCs  as  a  tool  for  law  enforcement  to  routinely 
videotape  outside  of  such  situations.  BWCs  should  not  be  used  to  conduct  general 
surveillance  in  schools  or  at  school  activities  or  to  record  any  non-criminal  conduct  by 
students, teachers, or parents in school or at school activities.  
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key Finding: The DCJS BWC Policy includes no reference to any special 
considerations  regarding  the  use  of  BWCs  on  school  grounds  or  at 
school activities. 

 

 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Only  three  departments  studied  explicitly  reference  the 
use of BWCs on school grounds. 
Virginia holds the unenviable position of sending a greater percentage of its 
students  to  law  enforcement  than  any  other  state  in  the  nation.46  The 
overreliance by Virginia’s public schools on law enforcement and the courts 
to correct student misbehavior makes the need to restrict the use of BWCs on 
school grounds that much more vital. Yet, only three departments discuss the 
use of BWCs on school grounds.  

17 

Isle  of  Wight  County  Sheriff’s  Office  mandates  that  BWCs  be  rendered 
inactive  while  school  resource  officers  (SRO)  are  on  school  grounds  or  at  a 
school  related  activity  or  event,  unless  the  SRO  believes  a  there  arises  a 
legitimate  law  enforcement  need  to  activate  the  BWC.47  Chesapeake  Police 
Department  permits  its  SROs  to  activate  their  BWCs  “in  cases  of  suspected 
criminal  activity  or  when  assisting  school  personnel  with  matters  that  may 
result  in  disorderly  or  otherwise  disruptive  behavior  in  the  school 
environment.”48  The  Suffolk  Police  Department  policy  prohibits  the  use  of 
BWCs in school clinics and locker rooms and requires school administrators 
seeking BWC data to make a written request to the relevant SRO.49  

Thus,  not  only  do  56  out  of  59  policies  fail  to  discuss  if  and  when  law 
enforcement  can  activate  BWCs  on  school  grounds,  but  the  three 
departments  that  do  include  in  the  policies  the  use  of  BWCs  on  school 
grounds  fail  to  sufficiently  restrict  their  use,  with  Chesapeake  Police 
Department  affirmatively  permitting  its  SROs  to  activate  BWCs  to  record 
non-criminal student behavior. 

 

 

 
Protecting the Public’s Right to Know 
The  policies  governing  the  collection  and  dissemination  of  personally  identifiable  data 
using BWCs should respect both the individual right of privacy of the data subject and the 
right of the public to access to public records. 
 
Recommendation No. 9  –  BWC policies should allow for public disclosure of videos on 
matters of public concern. 
 
Discussion:  
As the Police Executive Research Forum noted, “[a] police department that deploys BWCs is 
making  a  statement  that  it  believes  the  actions  of  its  officers  are  a  matter  of  public 
record.”50  Thus,  unless  prohibited  by  the  Virginia  Freedom  of  Information  Act51  or  the 
Virginia  Government  Data  Collection  and  Dissemination  Practices  Act52,  law  enforcement 
should  err  on  the  side  of  disclosure.  Nevertheless,  while  law  enforcement  departments 
should  embrace  disclosure,  they  should  do  so  in  a  way  that  minimizes  invasiveness.  For 
example: 

  Any video not part of an active investigation should be made available for public 

disclosure if consent of subjects involved is granted. 
 

  Law  enforcement  departments  should  redact,  when  feasible,  the  identity  of 

subjects recorded. 
 

  Unflagged and unredacted data should not be publicly disclosed unless consent 

of all subjects involved is granted.  
 

  State  law  and  local  policies  should  prohibit  the  disclosure  of  data  for  any 

commercial purpose.  

 

18 

 

  Local elected officials should ensure that police departments adopt policies that 
they  will  not  invoke  the  “law  enforcement  records”  exception  to  open  records 
laws  for  videos  where  officer  misconduct  is  involved,  as  the  general  principles 
behind that exception do not apply in such instances. 

 
As  discussed  in  the  section  on  the  need  for  uniformity  above,  access  to  data  should  be 
defined in state law so that policies are uniform across the Commonwealth. The right to see 
personally  identifiable  data  maintained  by  government  should  not  vary  jurisdiction  by 
jurisdiction.  The  law  should  compel  disclosure  rather  than  allow  it.  Appropriate  changes 
should  be  made  in  the  Virginia  FOIA  to  allow  BWC  policies  to  be  implemented  that  meet 
these standards. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  should 
include  specific 
encouragement  of  transparency  rather  than  limiting  further  the 
discretion to make data public under FOIA. 
The DCJS BWC Policy refers to the Freedom of Information Act and replaces 
exceptions granted in the Act for release of data with mandates that certain 
information  be  held  confidential.  Section  III.  F.  7.  Implementation  of  this 
“model”  DCJS  BWC  Policy  will  be  destructive  of  transparency  and 
accountability needed to restore trust. 

 

 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Local  policies  generally  make  no  clear  reference  to  a 
process  for  public  access  to  BWC  data  and  rely  on  the  Freedom  of 
Information Act which allows broad discretion in denying the release of 
information. 
Public information access as outlined in existing BWC policies varies greatly. 
Forty out of 59 policies make no clear reference to a process for public access 
to  BWC  data.53  Two  departments  make  no  clear  reference  in  their  policies, 
but  included  general  public  access  information  in  their  written  response  to 
the ACLU of Virginia FOIA.54  

Three  departments  make  no  clear  reference  to  a  process  (e.g.  FOIA  or 
department policy), but include specific information regarding disclosure of 
data.  Of  these  three,  Gordonsville  Police  Department  states  that  a  “request 
from the media or other non-law enforcement agencies may be charged a fee 
of $25.00 . . . . All such requests are asked to be in writing and from persons 
entitled to view such recordings.”55 York/Poquoson Sheriff`s Office’s process 
is unclear from its policy, but it does note that “due to the heightened privacy 
concerns associated with a video recording, any video recording disclosed to 
the  media  may  be  edited/redacted  to  preserve  the  privacy  of  individuals 
unrelated to the case who were captured on a recording."56 Frederick County

Sheriff`s Office’s policy is unclear from its policy, but requests from media or 
individuals must be accompanied by a minimum fee of $25 per event.57   

Of those that do refer to a process, with one exception,58 all mention that data 
is  available  either  through  an  existing  process,  such  as  departmental  policy 
or the  Freedom of Information Act.59  But, the  departments that do mention 
an existing process fail to clarify disclosure issues that may be unique to data 
collected  via  BWC,  such  as  policies  surrounding  whether  individuals  not 
present in the audio and visual depictions captured by the BWC may access 
that data. Instead, they revert to stock language. Moreover, a recent Advisory 
Opinion issued by the Freedom of Information Act Council complicates these 
issues  by  indicating  that  different  rules  regarding  disclosure  of  information 
govern local police and Sheriffs than other law enforcement agencies. 

 
Recommendation  No.  10  –  BWC  policies  must  provide  for  videos  to  be  flagged  when 
uploaded indicating whether they are related to a criminal investigation, a personnel 
matter (any use of force incident or other incident that could result in a complaint) or 
other matter (e.g., a non-criminal traffic stop or other engagement with the public that 
does not result in criminal charges). 
 
Discussion: 
BWCs  should  be  viewed  by  law  enforcement  as  a  tool  to  increase  police  accountability, 
transparency, and trust between law enforcement and the community. Therefore, any data 
collected by BWCs should be stored only as long as necessary to further the purpose of the 
BWCs  and  should  be  permanently  deleted  as  soon  as  the  data  is  no  longer  useful  for  the 
purpose of police accountability and oversight.   
 
Retention policies should be sufficient to ensure proper review of BWC data. The retention 
time  for  data  maintained  by  a  law  enforcement  department  should  be  governed  by  a 
flagging  system.  Any  data  collected  that  involves  a  use  of  force,  interaction  that  led  to  a 
detention  or  arrest,  or  interaction  that  led  to  a  formal  or  informal  complaint  shall  be 
flagged. In addition to these automatic flags, any subject of a recording or law enforcement 
supervisors or internal investigators should be able to flag a recording.  
 
There is wide variation among BWC policies at the local level and the DCJS BWC Policy only 
adds to the confusion by using new and undefined terms. As discussed in the section above 
on the need for uniform state policies, the findings below demonstrate unequivocally that 
the Commonwealth needs a set of minimum standards for data collection and flagging that 
all law enforcement departments must follow.  
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key Finding: The DCJS BWC Policy provides for video files to be marked 
as  “evidentiary,  non-evidentiary,  or  training  demo”  when  uploaded. 
Section III.C.10. 
The terms used in the DCJS BWC Policy are not defined and are not the terms 

 

20 

 

 

used to guide decisions about disclosure of information either in the Virginia 
FOIA or in the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act. 
The use of these undefined terms will confuse rather than help resolve issues 
regarding permitted and required disclosures of data. 

Local Policies 

Key Finding: 
Law enforcement policies vary greatly vis-à-vis what data is maintained and 
how data is flagged. Just 33 of 59 policies mandate that officers download all 
data  from  BWCs.60  Sixteen  departments  utilize  a  policy  that  appears  to 
require  that  all  BWC  data  be  downloaded,  but  includes  language  that  does 
not explicitly mandate that all BWC data be downloaded.61 Finally, 10 policies 
lack any clarity regarding what BWC data must be downloaded.62  

Law enforcement policies  across the  Commonwealth vary greatly regarding 
how  BWC  data  is  stored  after  being  downloaded.  For  example,  43  of  59 
policies  create  some  variation  of  a  flagging  system  that  distinguishes 
between  and  creates  guidelines  for  evidentiary  and  non-evidentiary  data 
(flagged and unflagged).63 An additional 12 departments utilize a policy that 
provides clarity for one type of BWC data (e.g. flagged/evidentiary), but not 
for  other  types  of  data.64  Two  additional  departments  appear  to  grant 
officers  discretion  over  how  data  is  stored.65  Finally,  two  departments 
provide no clarity regarding what data is downloaded and how it is flagged,66 
though Aquia Harbour Police Department did note in its response that data is 
deleted after 90 days if not needed for court.  

 
Recommendation No. 11 – BWC policies must provide that videos flagged as related to 
criminal  investigations  or  personnel  matters  shall  be  maintained  for  as  long  as 
provided by current Virginia law pertaining to criminal records and for the statute of 
limitations  period  for  civil  matters.  Records  not  tagged  should  be  purged  as  soon  as 
the minimum retention period expires. 
 
Discussion: 
Retention  policies  should  follow  a  state  mandated  policy  that  sets  clear  guidelines  for 
length  of  data  retention.  The  length  of  retention  should  be  based  on  the  type  of  data 
collected.  
 
All  flagged  data  involving  a  possible  civil  complaint  against  a  law  enforcement  officer 
should be stored until the completion of any related investigations and court proceedings 
and should be permanently deleted following the conclusion of the investigation(s) and any 
related court proceedings or at the end of the statute of limitations period unless required 
to  be  maintained  in  the  officer’s  personnel  file.  All  flagged  data  involving  an  alleged 
misdemeanor offense should be stored for one year or until final judgment and all appeals 
are exhausted, whichever comes first. All flagged data that is evidence of an alleged felony 
offense  should  be  maintained  indefinitely  given  that  there  is  no  statute  of  limitations  on 

 

21 

felonies.  If  the  felony  is  charged  and  tried,  the  video  data  should  be  kept  with  the  file  as 
required with respect to any evidence. 
 
Unflagged  data  should  be  purged  routinely  in  accordance  with  state  record  retention 
policies unless the data subject requests that it be held for a longer period. 
 
As  the  findings  below  demonstrate,  BWC  data  retention  periods  vary  greatly  across  the 
Commonwealth.  As discussed in the  section above  on the  need for uniform state policies, 
this is an issue on which state law should set uniform standards to be followed and applied 
by all law enforcement agencies. 
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  provides  that  all  records  should  be 
stored  in  accordance  with  the  records  and  retention  schedules  issued 
by the Library of Virginia. 
There  is  no  provision  in  the  DCJS  BWC  Policy  for  a  data  subject  to  request 
that the records be maintained for a longer period of time, which means that 
data  not  flagged  by  the  agency  as  related  to  a  criminal  or  administrative 
personnel investigation could be destroyed in 30 days without notice to the 
data  subject  even  though  the  subject’s  right  to  pursue  constitutional  claims 
against a department is subject to a two-year statute of limitations and their 
exposure to a felony prosecution is unlimited by time. 

 

 

 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Local  departments  maintain  vastly  different  BWC  data 
retention policies.  
Forty-three  law  enforcement  departments  follow  a  policy  that  creates 
includes  some  form  of  guidance  for  the  storage  of  flagged  and  un-flagged 
data,  though  the  specifics  of  these  policies  vary  greatly.67  For  example, 
Orange  Police  Department  maintains  all  data 
indefinitely68  while 
Chincoteague  Police  Department  maintains  un-flagged  for  30  days  and 
evidentiary  data  for  30  days  or  until  the  case  is  resolved  or  evidence  is 
released, whichever is longer.69 

Twelve  departments  provide  clarity  for  only  one  type  of  data  (e.g.  un-
flagged), but fail to provide clarity for retention periods covering other types 
of  data.70  For  example,  the  Brunswick  County  Sheriff`s  Office  maintains  un-
flagged data for three months, and if, during this time, data is determined to 
be evidentiary then it will be flagged and transferred to a disk for undefined 
“court purposes” that lack any specific retention schedule.71  

Two departments create a retention policy that grants each individual officer 
the  discretion  to  determine  the  retention  period.  Haymarket  Police 
Department  allows  the  officer  to  maintain  the  data  until  they  are  certain  it 
will no longer be needed72 and Hopewell Sheriff’s Office allows its officers to 

22 

maintain the data until “it is determined that there is no further need for the 
video,”73 though who makes that determination is unclear. 

 

Finally,  two  departments  do  not  provide  any  clarity  regarding  BWC  data 
retention  periods,74  though  Aquia  Harbour Police  Department did include  a 
retention  period  for  what  appears  to  be  un-flagged  data  in  its  written 
response to the ACLU of Virginia FOIA.75  

 
Assuring Accountability 
The  purpose  of  BWCs  is  to  promote  accountability.  As  such,  it  is  necessary  that  law 
enforcement  department  policies  include  mechanisms  that  ensure  sufficient  discipline  or 
other actions when an officer fails to follow the department’s policy. These accountability 
policies  should  be  uniform  across  the  Commonwealth  for  the  protection  of  both  officers 
and the public alike. 
 
Recommendation  No.  12  –  BWC  policies  must  be  explicit  and  mandatory  regarding 
activation  of  BWCs  by  individual  officers  at  the  inception  of  every  law  enforcement 
encounter with a civilian including stops, frisks, searches, arrests, consensual searches 
and interviews, enforcement actions and any encounter that becomes confrontational 
or in any way hostile. 
 
Discussion: 
To ensure public trust and an accurate depiction of events, BWC policies must ensure that 
law enforcement  officers cannot  determine  which encounters to  record and which to not 
record. Allowing law enforcement to “edit on the fly” by turning the BWCs on and off at will 
would remove the utility of BWCs as an accountability mechanism.76  
 
Law enforcement department policies should mandate the activation of BWCs whenever a 
law enforcement officer is responding to a call for service or at the initiation of any other 
law  enforcement  or  investigative  interaction  between  a  law  enforcement  officer  and  a 
member of the public. The BWC shall remain active until the interaction has concluded and 
the law enforcement officer has left the scene. The only exception to this mandate should 
be instances when an immediate threat to the law enforcement officer’s life or safety makes 
activating  the  camera  impossible  or  dangerous.  When  this  exception  arises,  the  law 
enforcement officer should activate the camera as soon as reasonably possible.   
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  includes  appropriate  requirements 
regarding the activation of BWCs. 
The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  requires  activation  of  BWCs  during  “each  law 
enforcement-public  encounter related to  a  call for service, law enforcement 
action, subject stop, traffic stop, and/or police/deputy services provided that 
such activation does not interfere with officer/deputy safety or the safety of 
others. Section III.C.3.

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Local  policies  generally  provide  clear  expectations  for 
when  BWCs  must  be  activated  but  do  not  require  activation  in  all 
situations  in  which  the  ACLU  recommends  nondiscretionary  use  in 
order to provide the level of transparency and accountability needed to 
make  BWCs  effective  tools  in  helping  to  restore  public  trust  in  law 
enforcement. 
A basic principle of any good BWC policy is the assurance that officers cannot 
edit on the fly. The public should be confident that video and audio collected 
via BWCs presents the  entire  interaction  between  law enforcement and the 
civilian, and not just the part that law enforcement want you to see. The best 
way  to  ensure  this  is  to  provide  law  enforcement  officers  with  clear 
directives  regarding  who  must  wear  BWCs,  when  they  must  activate  the 
BWC, and for what duration must the BWC stay activated.   

The  ACLU  of  Virginia’s  review  of  the  59  policies  shows  that  many  law 
enforcement  departments  permit  their  officers  a  great  deal  of  discretion, 
undermining  the  purpose  of  BWCs.  For  example,  while  a  majority  of  the 
policies (52 of 59) provide personnel with clear expectations for when BWCs 
must  be  activated,77  only  39  departments  include  requirements  that  could 
arguably  require  filming  when  responding  to  calls  for  service  or  at  the 
initiation of law enforcement and investigative encounters.78 The remaining 
20 policies range from requiring use of body cams during investigative or law 
enforcement  actions,79  to  providing 
law  enforcement  with  complete 
discretion  vis-à-vis  activation  of  their  BWC.80  Of  the  6  policies  that  do  not 
require  BWC  use  in  certain  situations,81  the  policies  range  from  those  that 
complete discretion82 to those that “strongly encourage” BWC use in certain 
situations.83  

In addition to the broad discretion granted to law enforcement vis-à-vis what 
law enforcement-community encounters require BWC activation, a review of 
BWC  policies  also  shows  law  enforcement  officers  enjoy  broad  discretion 
over  the  duration  of  the  recording.  Forty-nine  of  59  policies  require  law 
enforcement  to  activate  their  BWC  until  the  law  enforcement  action  is 
complete,84  but  only  20  of  59  policies  clarify  that  the  event  should  be 
recorded  from  contact85  through  conclusion.86  Those  that  do  not  specify  a 
timeframe that the BWC must be activated range from including no language 
relevant to duration87 to a policy that permits officers to “intermittently re-
start [the BWCs] to keep tape segments short.”88 

For BWCs to function as a tool to enhance transparency, accountability, and 
public trust in Law enforcement, community members must be assured that 
the  BWCs  provide  an  honest,  unedited  picture  of  law  enforcement-
community  encounters.  As  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  found,  most  Virginia  law 
enforcement  agencies  cannot  offer  that  assurance.  Accordingly,  this  is  an 

24 

issue  that  should  be  resolved  by  enacting  a  state  statute  that  applies  the 
same rule across all agencies that choose to deploy BWCs. 

 
Recommendation  No.  13  –  BWC  policies  must  prohibit  officers  from  reviewing  BWC 
video before writing their reports of incidents in which they are involved that involve 
use of force or alleged misconduct. 
 
Discussion: 
Allowing law enforcement officers to view their BWC data prior to submitting their report 
regarding  a  use  of  force  or  other  misconduct  incident  risks  undermining  fairness  of  the 
review  or  investigatory  process  and  will  risk  harm  to  law-enforcement-community  trust. 
Enabling  officers  to  review  the  video  data  before  submitting  their  report  would  provide 
them  with  an  opportunity  to  amend  their  story  to  fit  the  facts  as  witnessed  on  the  BWC, 
including  the  ability  to  omit  facts  that  were  not  caught  on  the  BWC.  This  would  create  a 
new precedent for law enforcement.  
 
As  Los  Angeles  Police  Department  (LAPD)  Commander  Andrew  Smith  noted  when 
discussing why they don’t let witnesses view autopsy results prior to their testimony, “’We 
don’t  want  the  witnesses’  testimony  to  be  tainted,’  Smith  said.  Detectives  want  to  obtain 
‘clean  interviews’  from  people,  rather  than  a  repetition  of  what  they  may  have  seen in 
media reports about Ford’s death, he added. ‘They could use information from the autopsy 
to give credibility to their story[.]’” 89 Enabling officers to view their footage would not only 
taint the process, but would also give them an advantage not afforded to the public. There 
is no room for special treatment when we are talking about justice and accountability.  
 
Not only would providing officers with a special right to view the BWC data undermine the 
basic trust and accountability values that argue for introduction of BWCs, but it also creates 
an  opportunity  for  an  unintentional  shifting  of  one’s  memory.  As  the  ACLU  of  Southern 
California  wrote  in  a  letter  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Justice  Assistance  challenging  the 
LAPD’s application to for funds to purchase BWCs, “[a] wealth of studies show the ways in 
which  suggestion  and  the  presentation  of  information  that  is  new  or  different  from  the 
individual’s  percipient  memory  will  actually  alter  the  memory  held  by  the  person. 
Exposure to information that is not captured in the original memory does nor supplement 
that memory; rather, it causes the entire memory to be reintegrated – to the point that the 
original memory is effectively lost.”90 As the letter went on to note, the Inspector General of 
the New York Police Department came to similar conclusions, and thus recommended that 
officers not review BWC data until after their initial statement is submitted.91  
 
By providing officers with the right to view video before submitting their initial report or 
statement, departments risk undermining they very law enforcement-community trust that 
BWCs have shown promise to create.   
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  specifically  allows  officers  and 
deputies to review video footage prior to preparing their reports. 

 

25 

Section III.F.3 of the DCJS BWC Policy explicitly authorizes officers/deputies 
to review video footage of “an incident in which they were involved” prior to 
preparing their report “or making a statement about the incident.” Allowing 
police  but  not  data  subjects  to  review  video  before  they  give  witness 
statements results in an unfair advantage and detracts from the ability of the 
law enforcement agency to evaluate the officer/deputy’s actions and defense 
of  them  based  on  the  officer/deputy’s  unaided  testimony.  This  is  especially 
problematic  in  cases  of  officer  involved-shootings  where  the  independent 
assessment  of  the  officer’s  state  of  mind  at  the  time  of  the  shooting  is 
essential to the investigation of the incident. 

 

Local Policies 

Key Finding:  
Current  policies  adopted  by  a  number  of  Virginia  law  enforcement 
departments  risk  undermining  the  law  enforcement-community  trust  that 
BWCs  were  supposed  to  create.  Twenty  departments  utilize  a  policy  that 
provides  no  clarity  on  whether  officers  can  view  BWC  data  prior  to 
submitting  their  report.92  Twenty-three  department  policies93  are  unclear 
about  whether  officers  have  an  affirmative  right  to  review  the  BWC  data 
prior  to  submitting  their  report,  but  the  policies  from  these  departments 
create  a  strong  presumption  that  officers  can  view  the  BWC  data  prior  to 
submitting  their  report,  as  they  generally  state  that  BWCs  can  be  used  to 
“enhance”94  and/or 
the 
Waynesboro Police Department policy96 states that BWCs are used, in part, to 
enhance officer reports, which implies that officers may view the data prior 
to  report  submission.  The Galax Police Department policy97 states  that only 
officers  suspected  of  wrongdoing  or  involved  in  a  shooting  may  be  denied 
access  to  BWC  data,98  thus  implying  that  officers  not  involved  in  the  listed 
actions  may  access  the  BWC  data.  Finally,  16  departments  include  a  clear, 
special  right  for  officers  to  view  BWC  data  prior  to  the  completion  of  their 
report.99 Among the departments that create this special right, the scope of it 
varies from departments that create a discretionary special right100 to those 
that create a mandatory special right.101 This system of special rights – rights 
not afforded to other witnesses – has no place in Virginia’s justice system.

Recommendation 14 – BWC policies must empower and encourage supervisory review 
of BWC videos to assure compliance with policies on their use. 
 
Discussion: 
Law  enforcement  BWC  policies  should  ensure  that  data  is  regularly  reviewed  to  ensure 
compliance with policies. Such reviews should be random. In addition, BWC policies should 
ensure that supervisors and civilian review boards review all footage flagged as involving a 
use or force or complaint.  
 
 
 

 

26 

Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key  Finding:  The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  includes  provisions  for  regular 
supervisory review of BWC video footage. Section III. D.1 
The  DCJS  BWC  Policy  gives  supervisors  the  right  to  review  “evidentiary” 
video  and  reclassify  it  for  indefinite  retention  if  there  is  a  complaint  or 
possibility  thereof,  and  to  conduct  “random  weekly  reviews  of  selected 
recordings’  to  assess  “officer/deputy  performance.”  Section  III.  D.1.  The 
policy  is  both  too  vague  (there  is  no  definition  of  what  constitutes  an 
evidentiary video) and too specific (why random, weekly reviews only?). The 
DCJS  BWC  Policy  should  give  broad  discretion  to  supervisors  to  conduct 
reviews as needed to determine compliance and require that they be done on 
a regular ongoing basis. 

 

Local Policies 

Key  Finding:  Less  than  half  of  the  law  enforcement  agencies  surveyed 
give supervisory personnel explicit authority to audit BWC programs to 
ensure compliance with policies on their use. 
A  key  to  holding  officers  accountable  is  their  knowledge  that  supervisors, 
even  absent  allegations  of  abuse,  can  review  their  actions.  While  24  of  59 
policies  grant  supervisors  the  authority  to  randomly  review  officer’s  BWC 
footage,102 and seven other policies arguably provide this authority,103 in 27 
of 59 policies it is unclear whether supervisors have this authority104 and it is 
prohibited at Woodstock Police Department.105 Sworn officers should not be 
held  to  different  standards  vis-à-vis  compliance  with  their  department 
orders  depending  on  what  jurisdiction  they  work  in.  All  officers  should  be 
held  accountable  to  their  department’s  policies,  and  should  be  subject  to 
decertification if they violate them. 

 
Recommendation  No.  15  –  BWC  policies  must  provide  that  the  failure  of  an  officer  to 
comply with policies regarding the use of BWCs will result in appropriate discipline, up 
to and including termination. 
 
Discussion: 
BWC  policies  must  ensure  that  they  include  disciplinary  mechanisms  that  incentivize 
compliance  with  the  department’s  policy.  For  example,  officers  who  fail  to  activate  their 
BWCs or fail to notify the subject that they are being recorded must be held accountable for 
their failure.  As such, law enforcement department personnel policies should ensure  that 
officers  who  fail  to  follow  the  BWC  policy  face  serious  employment  repercussions, 
including possible termination and, if authorized by state law, decertification.  
 
Findings: 

DCJS BWC Policy 

Key Finding: The DCJS BWC Policy does not specify clearly that officers 
will  be  disciplined,  and  possibly  terminated,  for  violating  the  policies 
on the use of BWCs. 

 

27 

Section III. E. of the DCJS BWC Policy regarding equipment states “intentional 
misuse  or  abuse  of  BWC  equipment  may  result  in  disciplinary  action.” 
Because of its placement in the DCJS BWC Policy in a section referring only to 
the issuance and use of the equipment, this statement does not clearly state 
that  violating  the  policies  that  protect  the  privacy  of  individuals  or  the 
public’s  right  to  know  would  lead  to  disciplinary  action.  In  addition,  the 
requirement  that  there  must  be  “intentional  misuse  or  abuse”  for  any 
discipline to be applied is too narrow a standard to assure the protection of 
the  public’s  interest  in  the  appropriate  use  of  BWCs  in  constitutional  and 
community policing. 

 

Local Policies 

Key Finding: More than half of the local agencies studied do not provide 
any  mechanism  for  holding  officers  who  violate  BWC  policies 
accountable. 
Officers  who  fail  to  follow  established  policies  should  not  benefit  because 
they work in a jurisdiction that lacks an accountability mechanism. Yet, that 
is exactly the process Virginia has established. For example, 23 of 59 policies 
lack  an  accountability  mechanism  for  officers  who  fail  to  comply  with  the 
BWC  policy.106  Thirty-six  of  59  policies  create  some  type  of  accountability 
mechanism,107  but  the  severity  of  these  mechanisms  vary  greatly,  from 
Radford  University  Police  Department’s  policy  of  creating  both  civil  and 
possible  criminal  penalty  options  if  the  threshold  is  met108  to  Colonial 
Heights  Police  Department’s  policy  that  creates  a  discretionary  disciplinary 
option.109  Thus,  depending  on  the  jurisdiction  in  which  an  officer  works,  in 
they may or may not get away with ignoring established policies.  

 
 
Conclusion 
 
The  deployment  of  BWCs  can  be  a  “win”  for  both  the  public  and  police.  The  purpose  of 
policies governing the use of BWCs is to create more transparent, accountable, and trusted 
law  enforcement  agencies  while  protecting  Virginians’  privacy  and  liberty.  As  with  many 
technological  advances  in  policing,  however,  the  deployment  of  this  technology  without 
proper safeguards and the right policies in place can  turn a tool meant to promote police 
accountability into a tool that expands the surveillance state.  
 
As  a  whole,  the  59  local  agency  BWC  policies  and 
the  DCJS  BWC  Policy  that  the  ACLU  of  Virginia 
analyzed fail to ensure that BWCs are deployed in a 
way  that  promotes  transparency,  accountability, 
and trust. The policies often do not articulate clearly 
what actions and events should be filmed, and they 
miss  the  mark  when  it  comes  to  protecting  the 
privacy  of  individuals  in  sensitive  situations.  They 

Local agencies and sheriffs will 
face particular difficulties 
implementing the data retention 
and disclosures policies that we 
recommend without appropriate 
changes in state law to assure 
uniformity across all law 
enforcement agencies.

do  not  properly  safeguard  footage  from  inappropriate  sharing.  They  fail  to  provide 
ordinary  citizens  access  to  their  own  data  to  which  they  are  entitled.  Finally,  they  lack 
mechanisms  to  hold  officers  accountable  for  intentionally  or  unintentionally  violating 
policy.  
 
As the summaries of the local policies show attached to this report at Appendix E, Virginia 
law enforcement agencies offer a divergent set of policies leaving Virginians without a clear 
understanding of when and how their interactions with law enforcement may be recorded 
or  their  data  disclosed.  Without  the  establishment  of  minimum  standards  uniformly 
applied  across  the  Commonwealth,  Virginians  cannot  be  assured  that  the  deployment  of 
body worn  cameras  by state or local police  agencies  is truly a  win-win for the  police and 
the public alike. Unfortunately, neither the local policies in place as of the summer of 2015 
nor  the  DCJS  BWC  Policy  recommended  to  the  Law  Enforcement  subpanel  of  the  Secure 
Commonwealth  Panel  in  September  2015  are  sufficient  to  get  Virginia  to  win-win.  In 
addition, local agencies and sheriffs will face particular difficulties implementing the data 
retention  and  disclosures  policies  that  we  recommend  without  appropriate  changes  in 
state law to assure uniformity across all law enforcement agencies.

Methodology 
 
In June, the ACLU of Virginia sent a request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA)  to  368  law  enforcement  agencies  asking  about  current  deployment  of  BWCs  and 
requesting  any  policies  or  regulations  in  place  to  guide  their  use.  A  copy  of  the  FOIA 
request is attached to this report as Appendix C.  
 
As  of  the  date  of  this  report,  in  response  to  the  FOIA  request  and  follow  up,  the  ACLU  of 
Virginia collected and reviewed policies from 59 local law enforcement agencies in Virginia 
that have deployed BWCs.110 Many others reported they were considering deploying BWCs 
but  had  no  policies  in  place.  Still  others  said  they  had  no  BWCs  and  no  plans  to  deploy 
them. Some law enforcement agencies initially provided no response to our FOIA request. 
The ACLU of Virginia followed up with some but not all of the agencies who failed to reply, 
believing that the sample of policies covered in this report is sufficiently representative of 
the  law  enforcement  agencies  in  Virginia,  and  thus  can provide  the  public  with  a  reliable 
picture of the deployment of BWCs in the Commonwealth. 
 
In  addition,  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  reviewed  the  Department  of  Criminal  Justice  Services’ 
model  BWC  Policy  (DCJS  BWC  Policy).  This  policy  is  the  product  of  deliberation  between 
various law enforcement entities. Civil liberties and community groups were not consulted 
during the development of the DCJS BWC Policy. A copy of the DCJS BWC Policy is attached 
as Appendix A to this report. 
 
To  ensure  an  accurate  and  consistent  review  of  the  BWC  policies,  the  ACLU  of  Virginia 
developed a 25-question document (Appendix D) that served as the baseline for reviewing 
each policy, including the DCJS BWC Policy. Each local policy is summarized in three charts 
in  Appendix  E  to  this  report  organized  under  the  following  headings:  Protecting  the 
Liberty, Rights and Privacy of Individual Virginians; Protecting the Public’s Right to Know; 
and Assuring Accountability.111 
 
In its review, the ACLU of Virginia only considered policies that were in effect at the time 
they were submitted to the ACLU of Virginia. In some cases, the policy was unclear, but the 
law enforcement representative responding to the request provided a statement regarding 
the  rules governing BWCs that  was  not  noted in the  official policy. This  report  includes  a 
notation clarifying to the reader anytime the report addressed an issue that was not part of 
the  approved  policy,  but  was  rather  a  position  provided  by  the  responding  law 
enforcement personnel. In addition, some issues, such as when cameras must be activated, 
required subjective judgment, as the language in certain policies did not necessarily match 
the ACLU of Virginia’s recommendations, but represented language substantially similar to 
the ACLU of Virginia’s recommendation. Cases that required subjective judgment are noted 
in  the  relevant  section  of  the  body  of  the  paper.  In  addition,  in  areas  where  the  policy 
lacked a clear answer, the report notes no policy.  
 
Finally,  to  provide  clarity  on  what  a  good  policy  should  include,  this  report  includes  the 
ACLU  of  Virginia  Model  BWC  Policy 
is  attached  as  Appendix  B.

cameras’ impact on reducing civil liability, addressing departmental complaints, and enhancing criminal 
prosecution, clearly demonstrates that administrative policy influences camera usage (MPD 2013).  
During the one-year evaluation, Mesa employed two different policies governing use of the camera: one that 
was restrictive (implemented the first six months) and one that gave officers much more discretion in 
determining when to record events (implemented the last six months). Camera use declined by 42 percent 
when the discretionary policy was in effect.”)

111  In  its  analysis,  the  ACLU  of  Virginia  only  considered  policies  that  were  in  effect  at  the  time  they  were 
submitted  to  the  ACLU  of  Virginia.  In  some  cases,  the  policy  was  unclear,  but  the  law  enforcement 
representative responding the request specifically provided a statement regarding the rules governing BWCs 
that was not noted in the official policy. In those cases, it is noted in the paper that a policy is not part of the 
approved policy, but is rather a position provided by the responding law enforcement personnel. In addition, 
some  issues,  such  as  when  cameras  must  be  activated,  required  subjective  judgment,  as  the  language  in 
certain policies did not necessarily match the ACLU of Virginia’s recommendations, but represented language 
substantially similar to the ACLU of Virginia’s recommendation. Cases that required subjective judgment are 
noted  in  the  relevant  section  of  the  body  of  the  paper.  In  addition,  in  areas  where  the  policy  lacked  a  clear 
answer, the compliance with ACLU of Virginia policy decision noted no policy.
