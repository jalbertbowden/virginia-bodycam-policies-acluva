This policy is for departmental use only and shall not apply in any criminal or civil proceedings. The Department policy
should not be construed as a creation of a higher legal standard of safety or care in an evidentiary sense with respect
to third party claims. Violations of this Directive will be basis for departmental administrative sanctions. Violations of
law will form the basis for civil and criminal sanctions in a recognized judicial setting.

 
I. Policy 
 
It  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  Radford  University  Police  Department  to  attempt  to  record the interaction between
officers and the public which may be used as evidence or to document situations that may call into question citizen
or  officer’s  conduct.    Recordings  may  be  audio or video or both mediums.  No  Department employee  shall  record a
conversation  with  or  between other  Department  employee(s), at  any  time  without  the  knowledge  of  the other
employee(s).  

 

 

II. Purpose

The  purpose  of  this  directive  is  to  ensure  that  relations  among  officers,  and  between officers and the public, are
maintained  according  to  the  highest  standards  of  professional  police  practices.    It will also encourage and enhance
open communication as well as avoiding any appearance of impropriety.

 

 

III. Procedure

Body Worn Camcorder or BWC

A.       All  Officers  are  equipped  with  a  Body  Warn  Camcorder (BWC).  In Pennsylvania  vs. Muniz,  the  U.S. Supreme
Court  held  that  an  officer  has  the  right  to  observe  what  the  officer  can  see  as  long  as the officer has a legal

file:///C|/Users/rsjohnso/Desktop/Policy%202015/Operations/O-47.html[6/4/2015 9:09:19 AM]

right  to  be  present.    It  follows  that  if  an  officer  may  observe,  an  officer  also  has  the  right  to photograph or
videotape. A recording is considered to be “one party consent”. The body worn Audio/Visual recording system is
used to accomplish several objectives including:

                        1.          Accurate  documentation  of  events,  actions,  conditions  and  statements  made  during  arrests
and critical incidents, so as to enhance officer reports, collection of evidence and testimony in
Court.

                         2.            The  enhancement  of  the  ability  to  review  probable  cause  for  arrest, arrest procedures,
officer  and  suspect  interaction,  and  evidence  for investigative purposes, and officer evaluation
and training. 

B.            All  officers  are  to  inspect  the  Body  Worn  Camcorder  system  for  damage  and  functionality.  Officers are not

authorized to make repairs or adjustments.

1.             The camera is the responsibility of the officer who has been assigned the camera.

2.             The camera is charged by way of a USB cord connected to a computer. Charging can be done

on any computer within the department or in-car computer while an officer is on patrol.

                     3.              Officers shall notify the Chief of Police or his/her designee by means of a memo if any damage

is found, repairs are needed, or if the unit is not working properly.

C.       Officers  are  to  exercise  reasonable  care  with  video  equipment.  Cameras  should be  checked  periodically  to

insure that they are properly worn and adjusted, and that the lanyard is attached to uniform.

 

D.      The video system shall be powered on whenever the officer is on duty. The officer shall  manually activate the
recording  device  when  he/she  exits  his/her  vehicle  for  a  call  and  with  any citizen contact.  Once activated, all
events will be recorded, both audio and visual.

 

1.              Officers will wear the BWC clipped on the center of the shirt. The lanyard will be worn inside

the shirt and connected to the officer’s vest to protect the BWC from being pulled loose.

                     2.              Officers  who  are  not  familiar  with  the  video  system  shall receive instruction on it from their

Supervisor or other properly trained person.

 

3.             Officers  shall  record  (both  visual  and  audio)  all  traffic  stops  and  any other incident that falls

into the receiving range of the video unit.

 
E.       Each Officer has been assigned a Secure Video Storage Folder located under their current RU Login. Officers are
required  to  download  all  videos  at  the  end  of  their  shift  to  this  video  folder.  BWC  videos will only be
downloaded to the specified officer’s folder, who recorded the video.

 
                            1.        Patrol Sergeants will insure that officers on their platoon download all videos from the BWC

to the designated folder.

                   2.        All  audio/visual  files  will  be  identified  with  a  time  and  date  and  officer  number  when  it  is

removed from the BWC and placed in the designated folder by the Officer.

                            3.          Officers are not authorized to remove, repair or tamper with the videos in any other way. 

                            4.         If  the  video  is  involving  a  felony  or  serious  misdemeanor  or  involved  an arrest or a Use of
Force, the officer’s supervisor will download a copy of the video to a CD or DVD. The CD or DVD
of the video will then be properly marked and submitted to the property room as evidence. 

                            5.        The  officer  will  document  in  the  police  report  that  the  video  was  copied and placed in the

property room.

                         6.            If  an  additional  copy  is  requested  by  the  Commonwealth  Attorney  or  by  Subpoena  Duces
Tecum,  a  request  will  be  completed  by  the  officer  using  the “BWC Request Form” located on
the Whale Server and forwarded to the Captain’s Office.

                            7.        The Captain or his designee will make a copy of the video and forward the copy to the officer
requesting the video, so it can be delivered to the Commonwealth Attorney or to an attorney if
required by Subpoena.

                            8.         THE CHIEF OF POLICE OR DESIGNEE IN HIS OR HER ABSENCE WILL MAKE THE FINAL DECISION

ON WHETHER OR NOT A VIDEO WILL BE RELEASED.

                             
 
F.        Retention of BWC Video recordings shall be in accordance with Library of Virginia GS-17,

Series 100796 and/or 100797 as applicable. 

             

G.        The  BWC  is  to  be  used  solely  for  official  law  enforcement  business. Prohibited non-law enforcement business

includes but is not limited to:

 

 

1.                Covertly recording other law enforcement personnel;

 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Recording  conversations  with  a  supervisor,  judge,  court  proceeding,  or  other government
employees;
 
Personal use of BWC;
 
Recording  a  conversation  that  the  officer  is  not  party  to,  unless  the  officer  is  handling  a  law
enforcement incident and is in a lawful position when the taping occurs.

H.      No employee of this Department is authorized to erase, modify, edit or in any manner tamper with a recording
medium. Any employee who erases, modifies, edits or tampers with a recording will be disciplined according to
the Police Department policies and may be subject to criminal sanctions.
