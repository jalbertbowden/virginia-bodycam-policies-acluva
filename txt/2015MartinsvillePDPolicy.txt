Body-worn Video Cameras – It will be a priority for our department to do everything possible 
to capture video and/or audio of use of force incidents as well as other confrontations with 
citizens.  Mandatory use of the body worn video cameras provides undeniable proof that our 
officers have conducted themselves in a professional manner.  
  
The Martinsville Police Department's body cameras video is stored on a server located in the 
Department's evidence room.  Police body camera videos are stored by the particular event the 
officer has recorded and selected for the event.  
  
The body camera videos along with in-car camera videos and interview room videos are 
controlled by an automatic digital video management system or DVMS. The amount of time that 
a video is maintained on the server is dependent upon the event description and the amount of 
disk storage available.  The DVMS starts cleanup (removal of videos) when disk usage is more 
than 80%; cleanup stops when disk usage is lowered to 70%. When disk usage is between 70% 
and 80% expired videos that have not been accessed in 150 days are deleted. Event descriptions 
with minimum and maximum storage times are as follows in terms of days:
